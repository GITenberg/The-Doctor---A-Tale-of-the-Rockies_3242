    <h3>
      THE OLD STONE MILL
    </h3>
    <p>
      There were two ways by which one could get to the Old Stone Mill. One,
      from the sideroad by a lane which, edged with grassy, flower-decked banks,
      wound between snake fences, along which straggled irregular clumps of
      hazel and blue beech, dogwood and thorn bushes, and beyond which stretched
      on one side fields of grain just heading out this bright June morning, and
      on the other side a long strip of hay fields of mixed timothy and red
      clover, generous of colour and perfume, which ran along the snake fence
      till it came to a potato patch which, in turn, led to an orchard where the
      lane began to drop down to the Mill valley.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the crest of the hill travellers with even the merest embryonic
      aesthetic taste were forced to pause. For there the valley with its sweet
      loveliness lay in full view before them. Far away to the right, out of an
      angle in the woods, ran the Mill Creek to fill the pond which brimmed
      gleaming to the green bank of the dam. Beyond the pond a sloping grassy
      sward showed green under an open beech and maple woods. On the hither side
      of the pond an orchard ran down hill to the water's edge, and at the
      nearer corner of the dam, among a clump of ancient willows, stood the Old
      Stone Mill, with house attached, and across the mill yard the shed and
      barn, all neat as a tidy housewife's kitchen. To the left of the mill,
      with its green turf-clad dam and placid gleaming pond, wandered off green
      fields of many shading colours, through which ran the Mill Creek, foaming
      as if enraged that it should have been even for a brief space paused in
      its flow to serve another's will. Then, beyond the many-shaded fields,
      woods again, spruce and tamarack, where the stream entered, and maple and
      beech on the higher levels. That was one way to the mill, the way the
      farmers took with their grist or their oats for old Charley Boyle to
      grind.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other way came in by the McKenzies' lane from the Concession Line,
      which ran at right angles to the sideroad. This was a mere foot path,
      sometimes used by riders who came for a bag of flour or meal when the
      barrel or bin had unawares run low. This path led through the beech and
      maple woods to the farther end of the dam, where it divided, to the right
      if one wished to go to the mill yard, and across the dam if one wished to
      reach the house. From any point of view the Old Stone Mill, with its dam
      and pond, its surrounding woods and fields and orchard, made a picture of
      rare loveliness, and suggestive of deep fulness of peace. At least, the
      woman standing at the dam, where the shade of the willows fell, found it
      so. The beauty, the quiet of the scene, rested her; the full sweet harmony
      of those many voices in which Nature pours forth herself on a summer day,
      stole in upon her heart and comforted her. She was a woman of striking
      appearance. Tall and straight she stood, a figure full of strength; her
      dark face stamped with features that bespoke her Highland ancestry, her
      black hair shot with silver threads, parting in waves over her forehead;
      her eyes deep set, black and sombre, glowing with that mystic light that
      shines only in eyes that have for generations peered into the gloom of
      Highland glens.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, it's a bonny spot,&rdquo; she sighed, her rugged face softening as she
      gazed. &ldquo;It's a bonny spot, and it would be a sore thing to part it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she stood looking and listening her face changed. Through the hum of
      the mill there pierced now and then the notes of a violin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that weary fiddle!&rdquo; she said with an impatient shake of her head. But
      in a few moments the impatience in her face passed into tender pity. &ldquo;Ah,
      well, well,&rdquo; she sighed, &ldquo;poor man, it is the kind heart he has,
      whateffer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She passed down the bank into the house, then through the large
      living-room, speckless in its thrifty order, into a longer room that
      joined house to mill. She glanced at the tall clock that stood beside the
      door. &ldquo;Mercy me!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;it's time my own work was done. But I'll
      just step in and see&mdash;&rdquo; She opened the door leading to the mill and
      stood silent. A neat little man with cheery, rosy face, clean-shaven, and
      with a mass of curly hair tinged with grey hanging about his forehead, was
      seated upon a chair tipped back against the wall, playing a violin with
      great vigour and unmistakable delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The mill's a-workin', mother,&rdquo; he cried without stopping his flying
      fingers, &ldquo;and I'm keepin' my eye upon her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head reproachfully at her husband. &ldquo;Ay, the mill is workin'
      indeed, but it's not of the mill you're thinking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of what then?&rdquo; he cried cheerily, still playing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is of that raising and of the dancing, I'll be bound you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wrong, mother,&rdquo; replied the little man exultant. &ldquo;Sure you're wrong.
      Listen to this. What is it now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; cried the woman, &ldquo;how do I know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But listen, Elsie, darlin',&rdquo; he cried, dropping into his Irish brogue.
      &ldquo;Don't you mind&mdash;&rdquo; and on he played for a few minutes. &ldquo;Now you mind,
      don't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, I mind, 'The Lass o' Gowrie.' But what of it?&rdquo; she cried,
      heroically struggling to maintain her stern appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      But even as she spoke her face, so amazing in its power of swiftly
      changing expression, took on a softer look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, there you are,&rdquo; cried the little man in triumph, &ldquo;now I know you
      remember. And it's twenty-four years to-morrow, Elsie, darlin', since&mdash;&rdquo;
       He suddenly dropped his violin on some meal bags at his side and sprang
      toward her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go away with you.&rdquo; She closed the door quickly behind her. &ldquo;Whisht now!
      Be quate now, I'm sayin'. You're just as foolish as ever you were.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Foolish? No mother, not foolish, but wise yon time, although it's foolish
      enough I've been often since. And,&rdquo; he added with a sigh, &ldquo;it's not much
      luck I've brought you, except for the boys. They'll do, perhaps, what I've
      not done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whisht now, lad,&rdquo; said his wife, patting his shoulder gently, for a great
      tenderness flowed over her eloquent face. &ldquo;What has come to you to-day? Go
      away now to your work,&rdquo; she added in her former tone, &ldquo;there's the hay
      waiting, you know well. Go now and I'll watch the grist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why would you watch the grist, mother?&rdquo; said a voice from the mill
      door, as a young man of eighteen years stepped inside. He was his mother's
      son. The same swarthy, rugged face, the same deep-set, sombre eyes, the
      same suggestion of strength in every line of his body, of power in every
      move he made and of passion in every glance. &ldquo;Indeed, you will do no such
      thing. Dad'll watch the grist and I'll slash down the hay in no time. And
      do you know, mother,&rdquo; he continued in a tone of suppressed excitement,
      &ldquo;have you heard the big news?&rdquo; His mother waited. &ldquo;He's coming home
      to-day. He's coming with the Murrays, and Alec will bring him to the
      raising.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A throb of light swept across the mother's face, but she only said in a
      voice calm and steady, &ldquo;Well, you'd better get that hay down. It'll be
      late enough before it is in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to her, Barney,&rdquo; cried her husband scornfully. &ldquo;And she'll not be
      going to the raising today, either. The boy'll be home by one in the
      morning, and sure that's time enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barney stood looking at his mother with a quiet smile on his face. &ldquo;We
      will have dinner early,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I'll just take a turn at the hay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned and entered the house without a word, while he took down the
      scythe from its peg, removed the blade from the snath and handed it to his
      father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give it a turn or two,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;you're better than me at this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here then,&rdquo; replied his father, handing him the violin, &ldquo;and you're
      better at this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They would not say so to-night, Dad,&rdquo; replied the lad as he took the
      violin from his father's hands, looking it over reverently. In a very few
      minutes his father came back with the scythe ready for work; and Barney,
      fastening it to the snath, again set off up the lane.

    <h2>
      II
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE DAUGHTER OF THE MANSE
    </h3>
    <p>
      Two hours later, down from the dusty sideroad, a girl swinging a milk pail
      in her hand turned into the mill lane. As she stepped from the glare and
      dust of the highroad into the lane, it seemed as if Nature had been
      waiting to find in her the touch that makes perfect; so truly, in all her
      fresh daintiness, did she seem a bit of that green shady lane with its
      sweet fragrance and its fresh beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had taken sixteen years of wholesome country life to round that supple
      form into its firm lines of grace, and to tint those moulded cheeks with
      the dainty bloom that seemed a reflection from the thistle heads that
      nodded at her through the snake fence. It had taken sixteen years of
      pure-hearted, joyous living to lend those eyes, azure as the sky above,
      their brave, clear glance; sixteen years of unsullied maidenhood to endow
      her with that divine something of mystery which, with its shy reserve and
      fearless trust, awakens reverence and rebukes impurity as with the vision
      of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her sunbonnet, fallen back from her yellow hair, shining golden in the
      sun, revealed a face strong, brave and kind, with just a touch of pride.
      The pride showed most, however, in the poise of her head and the carriage
      of her shoulders. But when the mobile lips parted in a smile over the
      straight rows of white teeth one forgot the pride and thought only of the
      soft persuasive lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she sprang up the green turf, she drew in deep breaths of
      clover-scented air, and exclaimed aloud, &ldquo;Oh, this is good!&rdquo; She peeped
      through the snake fence at the luscious rich masses of red clover. &ldquo;What a
      bed!&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;I believe I'll try it.&rdquo; Over the fence she sprang, and
      in a thorn tree's shade, deep in the fragrant blossoms, she stretched
      herself at full length upon her back. For some minutes she lay in the
      luxury of that fragrant bed looking up through the spreading thorn tree
      branches to the blue sky with its floating, fleecy clouds far overhead.
      The lazy drone of the bees in the clover beside her, the languorous summer
      airs swaying into gentle nodding the timothy stalks just above her head,
      and all the soothing sounds of a summer morning, that many-voiced choir
      that sings to the great God Nature's glad content that all is so very
      good, rested and comforted the girl's heart and body, making her know as
      she had not known before how very weary she had been and how deep an ache
      her heart had held.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it's good!&rdquo; she cried again, stretching her hands at full length
      above her head. &ldquo;I wish I could stay for one whole day, just here in the
      clover with the bees and the birds and the trees and the clouds and the
      blue sky, no children, no dinner, no tidying up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she lay there it seemed to her as if she had thrown off for the moment
      the load she had been carrying for many months. For a year she had tried
      to fill in the minister's household her mother's place. Without a day's
      warning the burden had been laid upon her shoulders, but with the fine
      courage that youth and love combine to give, denying herself even the poor
      luxury of indulgence of the grief that had fallen upon her young heart,
      she had given herself, without thought of anything heroic in her giving,
      to the caring for the house and the household, and the comforting as best
      she could of her father, suddenly bereft of her who had been to him not
      wife alone, but comrade and counsellor as well. Without a thought, she had
      at once surrendered all the bright plans that she, with her mother, had
      cherished for the cultivation of her varied talents, and had turned to the
      dull, monotonous routine of household duties with never a thought but that
      she must do it. There was no one else.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe I am tired,&rdquo; she said again aloud; then letting her heart
      follow her eyes into and beyond the blue above her, she cried softly, &ldquo;O
      mother, how tired you must have been with it all, and how much you did for
      me! For me, great, big lump that I am! Dear little mother. Oh, if I had
      only known! Oh, we were all so thoughtless!&rdquo; She stretched up her hands
      again to the blue sky with its fleecy clouds. &ldquo;For your sake, mother
      dear,&rdquo; she whispered. Not often had any seen those brave eyes dim with
      tears. Not often since that day when they had carried her mother out from
      the Manse and left her behind with the weeping, clinging children, and
      even now she hastily wiped the tears away, chiding herself the while. &ldquo;I
      never saw HER cry,&rdquo; she said to herself, &ldquo;not once, except for some of us.
      And I will try. I MUST try. It is hard to give up,&rdquo; and again the tears
      welled up in the brave blue eyes. &ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; she cried impatiently,
      sitting up straight, &ldquo;don't be a big, selfish baby. They're just the
      dearest little darlings in the world, and I'll do my best for them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her moment of self-pity was gone in a flood of shamed indignation. She
      locked her hands round her knees and looked about her. &ldquo;It is a beautiful
      world after all. And how near the beauty is to us; just over the fence and
      you are in the thick of it. Oh, but this is great!&rdquo; Once more she rolled
      in an ecstasy of luxurious delight in the clover and lay again supine,
      revelling in that riot of caressing sounds and scents.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kir-r-r-ink-a-chink, kir-r-r-ink-a-chink&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sprang up alert and listening. &ldquo;That is old Charley, I suppose, or
      Barney, perhaps, sharpening his scythe.&rdquo; She climbed up the conveniently
      jutting ends of the fence rails and looked over the field.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's Barney,&rdquo; she said, shading her eyes with her hand; &ldquo;I wonder he does
      not cut his fingers.&rdquo; She sat herself down upon the top rail and leaned
      against the stake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My! what a sweep,&rdquo; she said in admiring tones as the young man swayed to
      and fro in all the rhythmic grace of the mower's stride, swinging easily
      now backward the curving blade and then forward in a cutting sweep, clean
      and swift, laying the even swath. Alas! the clattering machine-knives have
      driven off from our hay-fields the mower's art with all its rhythmic
      grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those were days when men were famous according as they could &ldquo;cut off the
      heels of a rival mower.&rdquo; There are that grieve that, one by one, from
      field and from forest, are banished those ancient arts of daily toil by
      which men were wont to prove their might, their skill of hand and eye,
      their invincible endurance. But there still offer in life's stern daily
      fight full opportunity to prove manhood in ways less picturesque perhaps,
      but no less truly testing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Down the swath came Barney, his sinewy body swinging in very poetry of
      motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doesn't he do it well!&rdquo; said the girl, following with admiring eyes every
      movement of his well-poised frame. &ldquo;How big he is! Why&mdash;&rdquo; and her
      blue eyes widened with startled surprise, &ldquo;he's almost a man!&rdquo; The tint of
      the thistle bloom deepened in her cheek. She glanced down and made as if
      to spring to the ground; then settling herself resolutely back against her
      fence stake, she exclaimed, &ldquo;Pshaw! I don't care. He is just a boy.
      Anyway, I'm not going to mind Barney Boyle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On came the mower in mighty sweeps, cutting the swath clean out to the
      end.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well done!&rdquo; cried the girl. &ldquo;You'll be cutting off Long John's heels in a
      year or so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A year or so! If I can't do it to-day I never can. But I don't want to
      blow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn't. They're all talking about you, with your binding and
      pitching and cradling, and what not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are, are they? Who is good enough to waste breath on me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, everybody. The McKenzie girls were just telling me the other day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, pshaw! I ran away from their crowd, but that's nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I suppose you have not an idea how nice you look as you go swinging
      along?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I? That's the only time then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, now you're fishing, and I'm not going to bite. Where did you learn
      the scythe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where? Right here where we had to, Dick and I. By the way, he's coming
      home to-day.&rdquo; He glanced at her face quickly as he said this, but her face
      showed only a frank pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-day? Good. Won't your mother be glad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. And some other people, too,&rdquo; said Barney.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who, particularly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A sudden shyness seemed to seize the young man, but recovering himself,
      &ldquo;Well, I guess I will, myself, a little. This is the first time he has
      ever been away. We never slept a night apart from each other as long as I
      can mind till he went to college last year. He used to put his arm just
      round me here,&rdquo; touching his breast. &ldquo;I'll tell you the first nights after
      he went I used to feel for him in the dark and be sick to find the place
      empty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the girl doubtfully, &ldquo;I hope he won't be different. College
      does make a difference, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Different! Dick! He'd better not. I'll thrash the daylights out of him.
      But he won't be different. Not to us, nor,&rdquo; he added shyly, &ldquo;to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, to me?&rdquo; She laughed lightly. &ldquo;He had better not try any airs with
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would you do?&rdquo; inquired Barney. &ldquo;You couldn't take it out of his
      hide.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I'd fix him. I'd take him down,&rdquo; she replied with a knowing shake of
      her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Dick! He's in for a hard time,&rdquo; replied Barney. &ldquo;But nothing can
      change Dick. And I am awful glad he's coming to-day, in time for the
      raising, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The raising? Oh, yes. The McLeods'. Yes, I remember. And,&rdquo; regretfully,
      &ldquo;a big supper and a big spree afterwards in the new barn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are not you going?&rdquo; inquired Barney.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know. They want me to go to help, but I don't think I'll go. I
      don't think father would like me to go, and,&rdquo;&mdash;a pause&mdash;&ldquo;anyway,
      I don't think I can get away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, pshaw! Get Old Nancy in. She can take care of the children for once.
      You would like the raising. It's great fun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! wouldn't I, though? It's fine to see them racing. They get so wild
      and yell so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, come on then. You must come. They'll all be disappointed, if you
      don't. And Dick is coming that way, too. Alec Murray is to bring him on
      his way home from town.&rdquo; Again Barney glanced keenly at her face, but he
      saw only puzzled uncertainty there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don't know. We'll see. At any rate, I must go now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; cried Barney, &ldquo;I'll go with you. We're having dinner early
      to-day.&rdquo; He hung up the scythe in the thorn tree and threw the stone at
      the foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you would promise to come,&rdquo; he said earnestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you, really?&rdquo; The blue eyes turned full upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I do. It will be lots better fun if you are there.&rdquo; The frank,
      boyish honesty of his tone seemed to disappoint the blue eyes. Together in
      silence they set off down the lane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said, resuming their conversation, &ldquo;I don't think I can go,
      but I'll see. You'll be playing for the dancing, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I won't play if Dan is around, and I guess he'll be there. I may
      spell him a little perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you'll be dancing yourself. You're great at that, I know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me? Not much. It's Dick. Oh, he's a dandy! He's a bird! You ought to see
      him! I'll make him do the Highland Fling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Dick, Dick!&rdquo; she cried impatiently, &ldquo;everything is Dick with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barney glanced at her, and after a moment's pause said, &ldquo;Yes. I guess
      you're right. Everything is pretty much Dick with me. Next to my mother,
      Dick is the finest in all the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the crest of the hill they stood looking silently upon the scene spread
      out before them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There,&rdquo; said Barney, &ldquo;if I live to be a hundred years, I can't forget
      that,&rdquo; and he waved his hand over the valley. Then he continued, &ldquo;I tell
      you what, with the moon just over the pond there making a track of light
      across the pond&mdash;&rdquo; She glanced shyly at him. The sombre eyes were
      looking far away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; she said softly; &ldquo;it must be lovely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Through the silence that followed there rose and fell with musical cadence
      a call long and clear, &ldquo;Who-o-o-hoo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's mother,&rdquo; said Barney, answering the call with a quick shout.
      &ldquo;You'll be in time for dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dinner!&rdquo; she cried with a gasp. &ldquo;I'll have to get my buttermilk and other
      things and hurry home.&rdquo; And she ran at full speed down the hill and into
      the mill yard, followed by Barney protesting that it was too hot to run.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are you, Mrs. Boyle?&rdquo; she panted. &ldquo;I'm in an awful hurry. I'm after
      father's buttermilk and that recipe, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Boyle's eyes rested lovingly upon her flushed face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, there's no hurry, Margaret. Barney should not be letting you
      run.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Letting me!&rdquo; she laughed defiantly. &ldquo;Indeed, he had all he could do to
      keep up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that I had,&rdquo; said Barney, &ldquo;and, mother, tell her she must come to the
      raising.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And are you not going?&rdquo; said the older woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think so. You know father&mdash;well, he wouldn't care for me to
      be at the dance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, I know,&rdquo; quickly replied Mrs. Boyle, &ldquo;but you might just come
      with me and look quietly on. And, indeed, the change will be doing you
      good. I will just call for you, and speak to your father this afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don't know, Mrs. Boyle. I hardly think I ought.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hoots, lassie! Come away, then, into the milk-house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Back among the overhanging willows stood the little whitewashed log
      milkhouse, built over a little brook that gurgled clear and cool over the
      gravelly floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a lovely place,&rdquo; said Margaret, stepping along the foot stones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, it's clean and sweet,&rdquo; said Mrs. Boyle. &ldquo;And that is what you most
      need with the milk and butter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She took up an earthen jar from the gravelly bed and filled the girl's
      pail with buttermilk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Mrs. Boyle. And now for that recipe for the scones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Och, yes!&rdquo; said Mrs. Boyle. &ldquo;There's no recipe at all. It is just this
      way&mdash;&rdquo; And she elucidated the mysteries of sconemaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they will not taste a bit like yours, I'm sure,&rdquo; cried Margaret, in
      despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never you fear, lassie. You hurry away home now and get your dinner past,
      and we will call for you on our way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, lassie,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;your father will like this. It is only churned
      th' day.&rdquo; She rolled a pat of butter in a clean linen cloth, laid it
      between two rhubarb leaves and set it in a small basket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; said the girl as she kissed the dark cheek. &ldquo;You're far too
      kind to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor lassie, poor lassie, I would I could be kinder. It's a good girl you
      are, and a brave one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not very brave, I fear,&rdquo; replied the girl, as she quickly turned away and
      ran up the hill and out of sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor motherless lassie,&rdquo; said Mrs. Boyle, looking after her with loving
      eyes; &ldquo;it's a heavy care she has, and the minister, poor man, he can't see
      it. Well, well, she has the promise.&rdquo;

    <h3>
      THE RAISING
    </h3>
    <p>
      The building of a bank-barn was a watershed in farm chronology. Toward
      that event or from it the years took their flight. For many summers the
      big boulders were gathered from the fields and piled in a long heap at the
      bottom of the lane on their way to their ultimate destination, the
      foundation of the bank-barn. During the winter, previous the &ldquo;timber was
      got out.&rdquo; From the forest trees, maple, beech or elm&mdash;for the pine
      was long since gone&mdash;the main sills, the plates, the posts and
      cross-beams were squared and hauled to the site of the new barn. Hither
      also the sand from the pit at the big hill, and the stone from the heap at
      the bottom of the lane, were drawn. And before the snow had quite gone the
      lighter lumber&mdash;flooring, scantling, sheeting and shingles&mdash;were
      marshalled to the scene of action. Then with the spring the masons and
      framers appeared and began their work of organising from this mass of
      material the structure that was to be at once the pride of the farm and
      the symbol of its prosperity.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the very first the enterprise was carried on under the acknowledged,
      but none the less critical, observation of the immediate neighbourhood.
      For instance, it had been a matter of free discussion whether &ldquo;them
      timbers of McLeod's new barn wasn't too blamed heavy,&rdquo; and it was Jack
      McKenzie's openly expressed opinion that &ldquo;one of them 'purline plates' was
      so all-fired crooked that it would do for both sides at onct.&rdquo; But the
      confidence of the community in Jack Murray, framer, was sufficiently
      strong to allay serious forebodings. And by the time the masons had set
      firm and solid the many-coloured boulders in the foundation, the community
      at large had begun to take interest in the undertaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      The McLeod raising was to be an event of no ordinary importance. It had
      the distinction of being, in the words of Jack Murray, framer, &ldquo;the
      biggest thing in buildin's ever seen in them parts.&rdquo; Indeed, so
      magnificent were its dimensions that Ben Fallows, who stood just five feet
      in his stocking soles, and was, therefore, a man of considerable
      importance in his estimation, was overheard to exclaim with an air of
      finality, &ldquo;What! two twenty-foot floors and two thirty-foot mows! It
      cawn't be did.&rdquo; Such was, therefore, the magnitude of the undertaking, and
      such the far-famed hospitality of the McLeods, that no man within the
      range of the family acquaintance who was not sick, or away from home, or
      prevented by some special act of Providence, failed to appear at the
      raising that day.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was still the early afternoon, but most of the men invited were already
      there when the mill people drove up in the family democrat. The varied
      shouts of welcome that greeted them proclaimed their popularity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Barney! Good-day, Mrs. Boyle,&rdquo; said Mr. McLeod, who stood at the
      gate receiving his guests.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye've brought the baby, I see, Charley, me boy,&rdquo; shouted Tom Magee, a
      big, good-natured son of Erin, the richness of whose brogue twenty years
      of life in Canada had failed to impoverish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We could hardly leave the baby at home to-day,&rdquo; replied the miller, as
      with tender care he handed the green bag containing his precious violin to
      his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed, Mr. Boyle,&rdquo; replied Mr. McLeod. &ldquo;The girls yonder would
      hardly forgive us if Charley Boyle's fiddle were not to the fore. You'll
      find some oats in the granary, Barney. Come along, Mrs. Boyle. The wife
      will be glad of your help to keep those wild colts in order yonder, eh,
      Margaret, lassie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, it is not Margaret Robertson that will be needing to be kept in
      order,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Boyle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you be too sure of that, Mrs. Boyle,&rdquo; replied Mr. McLeod. &ldquo;A girl
      with an eye and a chin like that may break through any time, and then woe
      betide you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I warn you, don't try the curb on me,&rdquo; said Margaret, springing
      lightly over the wheel and turning away with Mrs. Boyle toward the house,
      which was humming with that indescribable but altogether bewitching medley
      of sounds that only a score or two of girls overflowing with life can
      produce.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come along, Charley,&rdquo; roared Magee. &ldquo;We're waitin' to make ye the boss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Tom,&rdquo; replied the little man, with a quiet chuckle. &ldquo;If you
      make me the boss, here's my orders, Up you get yourself and take hold of
      the gang. What do you say, men?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, that's it.&rdquo; &ldquo;Tom it is.&rdquo; &ldquo;Jump in, Tom,&rdquo; were the answering shouts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw now,&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;there's better than me here. Take Big Angus there.
      He's the man fer ye! Or what's the matter wid me frind, Rory Ross? It's
      the foine boss he'd make fer yez! Sure, he'll put the fire intil ye!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a general laugh at this reference to the brilliant colour of
      Rory's hair and face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never you mind Rory Ross, Tom Magee,&rdquo; said the fiery-headed,
      fiery-hearted little Highlander. &ldquo;When he's wanted, ye'll not find him far
      away, I'se warrant ye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no love lost between the two men. Both were framers, both famous
      captains, and more than once had they led the opposing forces at raisings.
      The awkward silence following Rory's hot speech was relieved by Charley
      Boyle's ready wit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll divide the work, boys,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Some men do the liftin' and
      others the yellin'. Tom and me'll do the yellin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A roar of laughter rose at Tom's expense, whose reputation as a worker was
      none too brilliant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right then, boys,&rdquo; roared Tom. &ldquo;Ye'll have to take it. Git togither
      an' quit yer blowin'.&rdquo; He cast an experienced eye over the ground where
      the huge timbers were strewn about in what to the uninitiated would seem
      wild confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Them's the sills,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Where's the skids?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right under yer nose, Tom,&rdquo; said the framer quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here they are, lads. Git up thim skids! Now thin, fer the sills. Grab
      aholt, min, they're not hot! All togither-r-r&mdash;heave! Togither-r-r&mdash;heave!
      Once more, heave! Walk her up, boys! Walk her up! Come on, Angus! Where's
      yer porridge gone to? Move over, two av ye! Don't take advantage av a
      little man loike that!&rdquo; Angus was just six feet four. &ldquo;Now thin, yer
      pikes! Shove her along! Up she is! Steady! Cant her over! How's that,
      framer? More to the east, is it? Climb up on her, ye cats, an' dig in yer
      claws! Now thin, east wid her! Togither-r-r&mdash;heave! Aw now, where are
      ye goin'? Don't be too rambunctious! Ye'll be afther knockin' a hole in
      to-morrow mornin'. Back a little now! Whoa! How's that, framer? Will that
      suit yer riverence? All right. Now thin, the nixt! Look lively there! The
      gurls are comin' down to pick the winners, an a small chance there'll be
      fer some of yez.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so with this running fire of exhortation, more or less pungent, the
      sills were got in place upon the walls, pinned and spliced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now thin, min fer the bints!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The &ldquo;bents&rdquo; were the cross sections of heavy square timbers which,
      fastened together with cross ties, formed the framework of the barn.
      Dividing his men into groups, the bents were put together on the barn
      floor, and, one by one, raised into their places, each one being firmly
      joined to the one previously erected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mind yer braces, now, an' yer pins!&rdquo; admonished Tom. &ldquo;We don't want no
      slitherin' timbers round here when we get into the ruction a little later
      on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In spite of all Tom's tumultuous vocal energy, it was nearly five before
      the last bent was reached. One by one they had fitted into their places,
      but not without some few hitches, each of which was the occasion for an
      outburst of exhortations on the part of the boss, more or less sulphurous,
      although the presence of the ladies interfered very considerably with
      Tom's fluency in this regard. He worked his men like galley slaves, and
      rowed them unmercifully. But for the most part they took it all with good
      humour, though some few who had the misfortune to fall specially under his
      tongue began to show signs that the lash had bitten into the raw. The
      timbers of the last bent were specially heavy, and the men, more or less
      fagged with their hard driving, didn't spring to their work with the
      alacrity that Tom deemed suitable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At it, min!&rdquo; he roared. &ldquo;Snatch it alive! Begob, ye'd think it was plate
      glass ye're liftin', ye're so tinder about it! Now thin! Togither-r-r&mdash;heave!
      Once again, heave! Ye didn't git it an inch that time! Stidy there a
      minute! Here you min on that pike, what in the blank, blank are ye
      bunchin' in one ind loike a swarm av bees on a cowld day! Shift over
      there, will ye!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In obedience to the word two pike-poles were withdrawn at the same moment,
      leaving only a single pike with Big Angus and two others to sustain the
      full weight of the heavy timbers. Immediately the bent swayed backward as
      if to fall upon the throng below. Some of the men sprang back from under
      the huge bent. It was a moment of supreme peril.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Howld there, fer yer lives, ye divils!&rdquo; howled Tom, &ldquo;or the hull of ye'll
      be in hell in two howly minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the cry Barney and Rory sprang to Angus's side and threw themselves
      upon the pike. Immediately they were followed by others, and the calamity
      was averted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Up wid her now thin, me lads, God bliss ye!&rdquo; cried Tom. But there was a
      new note in Tom's voice, the note that is heard when men stand in the
      presence of serious danger. There was no more pause. The bent was walked
      up to its place, pinned and made secure. Tom sprang down from the
      building, his face white, his voice shaking. &ldquo;Give me yer hand, Barney
      Boyle, an' yours, Rory Ross, for be all the saints an' the Blessid Virgin,
      ye saved min's lives this day!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Around the two crowded the men, shaking their hands and clapping them on
      the back with varied exclamations. &ldquo;You're the lads!&rdquo; &ldquo;Good boys!&rdquo; &ldquo;You're
      the stuff!&rdquo; &ldquo;Put it there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are ye doin' to us?&rdquo; cried Rory at last; &ldquo;I didn't see anything
      happen. Did you, Barney?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We did, though,&rdquo; answered the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      For once Tom Magee was silent. He walked about among the crowd chewing
      hard upon his quid of tobacco, fighting to recover his nerve. He had seen
      as no other of the men the terrible catastrophe from which the men had
      been saved. It was Charley Boyle that again relieved the strain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did any of you hear the cowbell?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It strikes me it's not
      quitting time yet. Better get your captains, hadn't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rory and Tom for captains!&rdquo; cried a voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not me, by the powers!&rdquo; said Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, come on, Tom. You'll be all right. Get your men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, am I? Be jabbers, I couldn't hit a pin onct in the same place,
      let alone twice. By me sowl, min, it's a splash of blood an' brains I've
      jist been lookin' at, an' that's true fer ye. Take Barney there. He's the
      man, I kin tell ye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This suggestion caught the crowd's fancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Barney it is!&rdquo; &ldquo;Rory and Barney!&rdquo; they yelled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me!&rdquo; cried Barney, seeking to escape through the crowd. &ldquo;I have never
      done anything but carry pins and braces at a raising all my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a loud laugh of scorn, for no man in all the crowd had Barney's
      reputation for agility, nerve and quickness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Carry pins, is it?&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;Ye can carry yer head level, me boy. So at
      it ye go, an' ye'll bate Rory fer me, so ye will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well then,&rdquo; cried Barney, &ldquo;I will, if you give me first choice, and I'll
      take Tom here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hooray!&rdquo; yelled Tom, &ldquo;I'm wid ye.&rdquo; So it was agreed, and in a few minutes
      the sides were chosen, little Ben Fallows falling to Rory as last choice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll give ye Ben,&rdquo; said Tom, whose nerve was coming back to him. &ldquo;We
      don't want to hog on ye too much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never you mind, Ben,&rdquo; said Rory, as the little Englishman strutted to his
      place among Rory's men. &ldquo;You'll earn your supper to-day with the best of
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I cawn't hearn it I can heat it, by Jove!&rdquo; cried Ben, to the huge
      delight of the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now the thrilling moment had arrived, for from this point out there
      was to be a life-and-death contest as to which side should complete each
      its part of the structure first. The main plates, the &ldquo;purline&rdquo; plates,
      posts and braces, the rafters and collar beams, must all be set securely
      in position. The side whose last man was first down from the building
      after its work was done claimed the victory. In two opposing lines a
      hundred men stood, hats, coats, vests and, in case of those told off to
      &ldquo;ride&rdquo; the plates, boots discarded. A brawny, sinewy lot they were, quick
      of eye and steady of nerve, strong of hand and sure of foot, men to be
      depended upon whether to raise a barn or to build an empire. The choice of
      sides fell to Rory, who took the north, or bank, side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Niver fret, Barney,&rdquo; cried Tom Magee, who in the near approach of battle
      was his own man again. &ldquo;Niver ye fret. It's birrds we are, an' the more
      air for us the better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Between the sides stood the framer ready to give the word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren't they splendid!&rdquo; said Margaret in a low tone to Mrs. Boyle, her
      cheek pale and her blue eyes blazing with excitement. &ldquo;Oh, if I were only
      a boy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said Mrs. Boyle, &ldquo;ye'd be riding the plate, I doubt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wouldn't I, though! My! they're fine!&rdquo; answered the girl, with her eyes
      upon Barney. And more eyes than hers were upon the young captain, whose
      rugged face showed pale even at that distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now then, men,&rdquo; cried the framer. &ldquo;Mind your pins. Are you ready?&rdquo;
       holding his hat high in the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ready,&rdquo; answered Rory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barney nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Git then!&rdquo; he cried, flinging his hat hard on the ground. Like hounds
      after a hare in full sight, like racers springing from the tape, they
      leaped at the timbers, every man to his place, yelling like men possessed.
      At once the admiring female friends broke into rival camps, wildly
      enthusiastic, fiercely partisan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well done, Rory! He's up first!&rdquo; cried a girl whose brilliant complexion
      and still more brilliant locks proclaimed her relationship to the captain
      of the north side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh! Barney'll soon catch him, you'll see,&rdquo; cried Margaret. &ldquo;Oh, Barney,
      hurry! hurry!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, he will need to hurry,&rdquo; cried Rory's sister, mercilessly
      exultant. &ldquo;He's up! He's up!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sure enough, Rory, riding the first half of his plate over the bent, had
      just &ldquo;broken it down,&rdquo; and in half a minute, seized by the men detailed
      for this duty, it was in its place upon the posts. Like cats, three men
      with mauls were upon it driving the pins home just as the second half was
      making its appearance over the bent, to be seized and placed and pinned as
      its mate had been.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's won! He's won!&rdquo; shrieked Rory's admiring faction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Barney! Barney!&rdquo; screamed his contingent reproachfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well done, Rory! Keep at it! You've got them beaten!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beaten, indeed!&rdquo; was the scornful reply. &ldquo;Just wait a minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They're at the 'purlines'!&rdquo; shrieked Rory's sister, and her friends,
      proceeding to scream wildly after the female method of expressing emotion
      under such circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My!&rdquo; sniffed a contemptuous member of Barney's faction, suffering
      unutterable pangs of humiliation. &ldquo;Some people don't mind making a show of
      themselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Barney! why don't you hurry?&rdquo; cried Margaret, to whose eager spirit
      Barney's movements seemed painfully and almost wilfully slow.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Barney had laid his plans. Dividing his men into squads, he had been
      carrying out the policy of simultaneous preparation, and while part of his
      men had been getting the plates to their places, others had been making
      ready the &ldquo;purlines&rdquo; and laying the rafters in order so that, although
      beaten by Rory in the initial stages of the struggle, when once his plates
      were in position, while Rory's men were rushing about in more or less
      confusion after their rafters, Barney's purlins and rafters moved to their
      positions as if by magic. Consequently, though when they arrived at the
      rafters Barney was half a dozen behind, the rest of his rafters were
      lifted almost as one into their places.
    </p>
    <p>
      At once the ranks of Barney's faction, which up to this point had been
      enduring the poignant pangs of what looked like humiliating defeat, rose
      in a tumult of triumph to heights of bliss inexpressible, save by a series
      of ear-piercing but altogether rapturous shrieks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They're down! They're down!&rdquo; screamed Margaret, dancing in an ecstasy of
      joy, while hand over hand down posts, catching at braces, slipping,
      sliding, springing, the men of both sides kept dropping from incredible
      distances to the ground. Suddenly through all the tumultuous shouts of
      victory a heart-rending scream rang out, followed by a shuddering groan
      and dead silence. One-half of Rory's purlin plate slipped from its
      splicing, the pin having been neglected in the furious haste, and swinging
      free, fell crashing through the timbers upon the scurrying, scrambling men
      below. On its way it swept off the middle bent Rory, who was madly
      entreating a laggard to drop to the earth, but who, flung by good fortune
      against a brace, clung there. On the plate went in its path of
      destruction, missing several men by hairs' breadths, but striking at last
      with smashing cruel force across the ankle of poor little Ben Fallows, in
      the act of sliding down a post to the ground. In a moment two or three men
      were beside him. He was lifted up groaning and screaming and carried to an
      open grassy spot. After some moments of confusion Barney was seen to
      emerge from the crowd and hurry after his horse. A stretcher was hastily
      knocked together, a mattress and pillow placed thereon, to which Ben,
      still groaning piteously, was tenderly lifted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll go wid ye,&rdquo; said Tom Magee, throwing on his coat and hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before they drove out of the yard the little Englishman pulled himself
      together. &ldquo;Stop a bit, Barney,&rdquo; he said. He beckoned Rory to his side.
      &ldquo;Tell them,&rdquo; he said between his gasps, &ldquo;not to spoil their supper for me.
      I cawn't heat my share, but I guess perhaps I hearned it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that you did, lad,&rdquo; cried Rory. &ldquo;No man better, and I'll tell them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The men who were standing near and who had heard Ben's words broke out
      into admiring expletives, &ldquo;Good boy, Benny!&rdquo; &ldquo;Benny's the stuff!&rdquo; till
      finally someone swinging his hat in the air cried, &ldquo;Three cheers for
      Benny!&rdquo; and the feelings of the crowd, held in check for so many minutes,
      at length found expression in three times three, and with the cheers
      ringing in his ears and with a smile upon his drawn face, poor Ben,
      forgetting his agony for the time, was borne away on his three-mile drive
      to the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The raising was over, but no man asked which side had won.

    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE DANCE
    </h3>
    <p>
      The dance was well on when Barney and Tom drove up to the McLeods' gate.
      They were met by Margaret and Barney's mother, who, with a group of girls
      and Mr. McLeod, had been waiting for them. As they drove into the yard
      they were met at once with eager questions as to the condition and fate of
      the unhappy Ben.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ben, is it?&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;Indeed, it's a hero we've discovered. He stud it
      like a brick. An' I'm not sure but there are two av thim,&rdquo; he said,
      jerking his thumb toward Barney. &ldquo;Ye ought to have seen him stand there
      houldin' the light an' passin' the doctor sthrings, an' the blood spoutin'
      like a stuck pig. What happened afther, it's mesilf can't tell ye at all,
      for I was restin' quietly by mesilf on the floor on the broad av me back,
      an' naither av thim takin' annythin' to do wid me except to drown me wid
      watther betune times. Indeed, it's himsilf is the born doctor, an' so he
      is,&rdquo; continued Tom, warming to his theme, &ldquo;for wid his hands red wid blood
      an' his face as white as yer apron, ma'am, niver a shiver did he give
      until the last knot was tied an' the last stitch was sewed. Bedad! there's
      not a man in the county could do the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no stopping Tom in his recital, and after many attempts Barney
      finally gave it up, and began unhitching his horse. Meantime the sound of
      the dancing had ceased, and suddenly up through the silence there rose a
      voice in song to the accompaniment of some stringed instrument. It was an
      arresting voice. The group about the horse stood perfectly still as the
      voice rose and soared and sank and rose again in an old familiar
      plantation air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who in thunder is that?&rdquo; cried Barney, turning to his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      But his mother shook her head. &ldquo;Indeed, I know not, but it's likely yon
      strange girl that came out from town with the Murrays.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; cried Teenie Ross, Rory's sister, with a little toss of her
      head, &ldquo;Alec told me. She is the girl who has come to take the teacher's
      place for a month. She is the niece of Sheriff Hossie. Her father was a
      colonel in the Southern army, California or Virginia or some place, I
      don't just remember. Oh! I know all about her, Alec told me,&rdquo; continued
      Teenie with a knowing shake of her ruddy curls. &ldquo;And she'll have a string
      of hearts dangling to her apron, if she wears one, before the month is
      out, so you'd better mind out, Barney.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Barney was not heeding her. &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; he said, holding up his hand, for
      again the voice was rising up clear and full into the night silence. Even
      Teenie's chatter was subdued and no one moved till the verse was finished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She'll be needing a boarding house, Barney,&rdquo; continued Teenie wickedly.
      &ldquo;You'll just need to take her with you to the Mill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, and there will be no such lassie as yon in my house,&rdquo; said the
      mother, speaking sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has no mother,&rdquo; said Margaret softly, &ldquo;and she will need a place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that she will,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Boyle, &ldquo;and I know very well where she
      will be going, too, and you with four little ones to do for, not to speak
      of the minister, the hardest of the lot.&rdquo; Mrs. Boyle was evidently
      seriously angered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Man! What a voice!&rdquo; breathed Barney, and, making fast the horse to the
      waggon, he set off for the barn apparently oblivious of all about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Begorra, ma'am, an' savin' yer prisince, there's nobody knows what's in
      that lad. But he'll stir the world yit, an' so he will. An' that's what
      the ould Doctor said, so it was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Barney reached the barn floor the Southern girl had just finished her
      song, and with her guitar still in her hands was idly strumming its
      strings. The moonlight fell about her in a flood so bright as to reveal
      the ivory pallor of her face and the lustrous depths of her dark eyes. It
      was a face of rare and romantic beauty framed in soft, fluffy, dark hair,
      brushed high off the forehead and gathered in a Greek knot at the back of
      her head. But besides the beauty of face and eyes, there was an air of
      gentle, appealing innocence that awakened the chivalrous instincts latent
      in every masculine heart, and a lazy, languorous grace that set her in
      striking contrast to the alert, vigorous country maids so perfectly able
      to care for themselves, asking odds of no man. When the singing ceased
      Barney came out of the shadow at his father's side, and, reaching for the
      violin, said, &ldquo;Let me spell you a bit, Dad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At his voice Dick, who was across the floor beside the singer, turned
      quickly and, seeing Barney, sprang for him, shouting, &ldquo;Hello! you old
      whale, you!&rdquo; The father hastily pulled his precious violin out of danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let go, Dick! Let go, I tell you!&rdquo; said Barney, struggling in his
      brother's embrace; &ldquo;stop it, now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a mighty effort he threw Dick off from him and stood on guard with an
      embarrassed, half-shamed, half-indignant laugh. The crowd gathered near in
      delighted expectation. There was always something sure to happen when Dick
      &ldquo;got after&rdquo; his older brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He won't let me kiss him,&rdquo; cried Dick pitifully, to the huge enjoyment of
      the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's too bad, Dick,&rdquo; they cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it is. But I'm not going to be put off. It's a shame!&rdquo; replied Dick,
      in a hurt tone. &ldquo;And me just home, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a mean shame, Dick. Wouldn't stand it a minute,&rdquo; cried his
      sympathisers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won't either,&rdquo; cried Dick, preparing to make an attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Dick,&rdquo; cried Barney impatiently, &ldquo;just quit your nonsense or
      I'll throw you on the floor there and sit on you. Besides, you're spoiling
      the music.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, that's so,&rdquo; said Dick. &ldquo;So on Miss Lane's account I'll
      forbear, provided, that is, she sings again, as, of course, she will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Dick's custom to assume command in every company where he found
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it to be? 'Dixie'?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes! Yes!&rdquo; cried the crowd. &ldquo;'Dixie.' We'll give you the chorus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a little protest the girl struck a few chords and dashed off into
      that old plantation song full of mingling pathos and humour. Barney picked
      up his father's violin, touched the strings softly till he found her key
      and then followed in a subdued accompaniment of weird chords. The girl
      turned herself toward him, her beautiful face lighting up as if she had
      caught a glimpse of a kindred spirit, and with a new richness and
      tenderness she poured forth the full flood of her song. The crowd were
      entranced with delight. Even those who had been somewhat impatient for the
      renewal of the dance joined in calls for another song. She turned to Dick,
      who had resumed his place beside her. &ldquo;Who is the man you wanted so badly
      to kiss?&rdquo; she asked quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who?&rdquo; he cried, so that everyone heard. &ldquo;What! don't you know? That's
      Barney, the one and only Barney, my brother. Here, Barney, drop your
      fiddle and be introduced to Miss Iola Lane, late from Virginia, or is it
      Maryland? Some of those heathen places beyond the Dixie line.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barney dropped the violin from his chin, came over the floor, and
      awkwardly offered his hand. With easy, lazy grace she rose from the block
      where she had been sitting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You accompany beautifully,&rdquo; she said in her soft Southern drawl; &ldquo;it's in
      you, I can see. No one can ever be taught to accompany like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, pshaw! That's nothing,&rdquo; said Barney, eager to get back again to his
      shadow, &ldquo;but if you don't mind I'll try to follow you if you sing again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; cried Dick, &ldquo;she'll sing again. What will you give us now,
      white or black?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Plantation, of course,&rdquo; said Barney brusquely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. 'Kentucky home,' eh?&rdquo; cried Dick.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl looked up at him with a saucy, defiant look. &ldquo;Do they all obey
      you here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's what,&rdquo; cried Alec Murray, &ldquo;especially the girls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She hesitated a few moments, evidently meditating rebellion, then turning
      to Barney, who was playing softly the air that had been asked for, &ldquo;You,
      too, obey, I see,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Generally&mdash;, always when I like,&rdquo; he replied, continuing to play.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; shrugging her shoulders, &ldquo;I suppose I must then.&rdquo; And she
      began:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;The sun shines bright on de old Kentucky home.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Again that hush fell upon the crowd. The face of the singer, with its
      dark, romantic beauty touched with the magic of the moonlight, the voice
      soft, mellow, vibrant with passion, like the deeper notes of a 'cello,
      supported by the weird chords of Barney's violin, held them breathless. No
      voice joined in the chorus. As she sang, the subtle telepathic waves came
      back from her audience to the girl, and with ever-deepening passion and
      abandon she poured forth into the moonlit silence the full throbbing tide
      of song. The old air, simple and time-worn, took on a new richness of tone
      colour and a fulness of volume suggestive of springs of unutterable
      depths. Even Dick's gay air of command surrendered to the spell. As
      before, silence followed the song.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you did not do your part,&rdquo; she said, smiling up at him with a very
      pretty air of embarrassment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Dick solemnly, &ldquo;we didn't dare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sing again,&rdquo; said Barney abruptly. His voice sounded deep and hoarse, and
      Dick, looking curiously at him, said apologetically, &ldquo;Music, when it's
      good, makes him quite batty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Iola ignored him. &ldquo;Did you ever hear this?&rdquo; she said to Barney. She
      strummed a few chords on her guitar. &ldquo;It's only a little baby song, one my
      old mammy used to sing.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Sleep, ma baby, close youah lil winkahs fas',
      Loo-la, Loo-la, don' you gib me any sass.
      Youah mammy's ol', an' want you to de berry las',
      So, baby, honey, let dose mean ol' angels pass.

      CHORUS:

     &ldquo;Sleep, ma baby, mammy can't let you go.
      Sleep, ma baby, de angels want you sho!
      De angels want you, guess I know,
      But mammy hol' you, hol' you tight jes' so.

     &ldquo;Sleep, ma baby, close youah lil fingahs, Meah,
      Loo-la, Loo-la, tight about ma fingahs heah,
      De dawk come close, but baby don' you nebbeh feah,
      Youah mammy'll hol' you, hol' you till de mawn appeah.

     &ldquo;Sleep, ma baby, why you lie so col', so col'?
      Loo-la, Loo-la, do Massa want you for His fol'?
      But, baby, honey, don' you know youah mammy's ol'
      An' want you, want you, oh, she want you jes' to hol'.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      A long silence followed the song. The girl laid her guitar down and sat
      quietly looking straight before her, while Barney played the refrain over
      and over. The simple pathos of the little song, its tender appeal to the
      mother-chords that somehow vibrate in all human hearts, reached the deep
      places in the honest hearts of her listeners and for some moments they
      stood silent about her. It was with an obvious effort that Dick released
      the tension by crying out, &ldquo;Partners for four-hand reel.&rdquo; Instantly the
      company resolved itself into groups of four and stood waiting for the
      music.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strike up, Barney,&rdquo; cried Dick impatiently, shuffling before Iola, whom
      he had chosen for his partner. But Barney, handing the violin to his
      father, slipped back into the shadow where his mother and Margaret were
      standing. The boy's face was pale through its swarthy tan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come away,&rdquo; he said to his mother in a strained, unnatural voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn't she beautiful?&rdquo; cried Margaret impulsively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she? I didn't notice. But great goodness! What a voice!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Um, some will be thinking so, I doubt,&rdquo; said Mrs. Boyle grimly, with a
      sharp glance at her son.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Barney had become oblivious to her words and glances. He moved away as
      in a dream to make ready for the home going of his party, for soon the
      dancers would be at Sir Roger's. Nor did he waken from his dream mood
      during the drive home. He could hear Dick chattering gaily to Margaret and
      his mother of his College experiences, but except for an occasional word
      with his father he sat in silence, gazing not upon the fields and woods
      that lay in all their moonlit glory about them, but upon that new world,
      vast, unreal, yet vividly present, whose horizon lay beyond the line of
      vision, the world of his imagination, where he must henceforth live and
      where his work must lie. For the events of the afternoon had summoned a
      new self into being, a self unfamiliar, but real and terribly insistent,
      demanding recognition. He could not analyse the change that had come to
      him, nor could he account for it. He did not try to. He lived again those
      great moments when, having been thrust by chance into the command of these
      fifty mighty men, he had swung them to victory. He remembered the ease,
      the perfect harmony with which his faculties had wrought through those few
      minutes of fierce struggle. Again he passed through the awful ordeal of
      the operation, now holding the light, now assisting with forceps or cord
      or needle, now sponging away that ghastly red flow that could not be
      stemmed. He wondered now at his self-mastery. He could see again his
      fingers, bloody, but unshaking, handing the old doctor a needle and silk
      cord. He remembered his surprise and pity, almost contempt, for big Tom
      Magee lying on the floor unable to lift his head; remembered, too, the
      strange absence of anything like elation at the doctor's words, &ldquo;My boy,
      you have the nerve and the fingers of a surgeon, and that's what your
      Maker intended you to be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he let his mind linger long and with thrilling joy through the
      interlude in the dance. Every detail of that scene stood clearly limned
      before his mind. The bare skeleton of the new harp, the crowding, eager,
      tense faces of the listeners, his mother's and Margaret's in the hindmost
      row, his brother standing in the centre foreground, the upturned face of
      the singer with its pale romantic loveliness, all in the mystery of the
      moonlight, and, soaring over all, that clear, vibrant, yet softly
      passionate, glorious voice. That was the final magic touch that rolled
      back the screen and set before him the new world which must henceforth be
      his. He could not explain that touch. The songs were the old simple airs
      worn threadbare by long use in the countryside. It was certainly not the
      songs. Nor was it the singer. Curiously enough, the girl, her personality,
      her character, worthy or unworthy, had only a subordinate place in his
      thought. He was conscious of her presence there as a subtle yet powerful
      influence, but as something detached from the upturned face illumined in
      the soft moonlight and the stream of heart-shaking song. She was to him
      thus far simply a vision and a voice, to which all the psychic element in
      him made eager response. As he drove into the quiet Mill yard it came upon
      him with a shock of pain that with the old life he had done forever. He
      felt himself already detached from it. The new self looking out upon its
      new world had shaken off his boyhood as the bursting leaf shakes off the
      husks of spring.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Dick's gay exclamation of delight at sight of the old home fell upon
      his ear a deeper pain struck him, for he vaguely felt that while his
      brother still held his place in the centre of the stage, that stage had
      immeasurably extended and was now peopled with other figures, shadowy, it
      is true, but there, and influential. His brother, who with his mother, or,
      indeed, perhaps more than his mother, had absorbed his boyish devotion,
      must henceforth share that devotion with others. Upon this thought his
      brother's voice broke in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter, old chap? Is there anything wrong?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The kindly tone stabbed like a knife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no. Nothing, Dick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but there is. You're not the same.&rdquo; At the anxious appeal in the
      voice Barney stood for a moment steadily regarding his brother, for whom
      he could easily give his life, with a troubled sense of change that he
      could not analyse to himself, much less explain to his brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know, Dick&mdash;I can't tell you&mdash;I don't think I am the
      same.&rdquo; A look of startled dismay fell swiftly down upon the frank,
      handsome face turned toward him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I done anything, Barney?&rdquo; said the younger boy, his dismay showing
      in his tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, Dick, boy, it has nothing to do with you.&rdquo; He put his hands on
      his brother's shoulders, the nearest thing to an embrace he ever allowed
      himself. &ldquo;It is in myself; but to you, my boy, I am the same.&rdquo; His speech
      came now hurriedly and with difficulty: &ldquo;And whatever comes to me or to
      you, Dick, remember I shall never change to you&mdash;remember that, Dick,
      to you I shall never change.&rdquo; His breath was coming in quick gasps. The
      younger boy gazed at his usually so undemonstrative brother. Suddenly he
      threw his arms about his neck, crying in a broken voice, &ldquo;You won't,
      Barney, I know you won't. If you ever do I don't want to live.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a single moment Barney held the boy in his arms, patting his shoulder
      gently, then, pushing him back, said impatiently, &ldquo;Well, I am a blamed old
      fool, anyway. What in the diggins is the matter with me, I don't know. I
      guess I want supper, nothing to eat since noon. But all the same, Dick,&rdquo;
       he added in a steady, matter-of-fact tone, &ldquo;we must expect many changes
      from this out, but we'll stand by each other till the world cracks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After Dick had gone upstairs with his father, Barney and his mother sat
      together talking over the doings of the day after their invariable custom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is looking thin, I am thinking,&rdquo; said the mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he's right enough. A few days after the reaper and a few meals out of
      your kitchen, mother, and he will be as fit as ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was a fine work of yours with the doctor.&rdquo; The indifferent tone did
      not deceive her son for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, pshaw, that was nothing. At least it seemed nothing then. There were
      things to be done, blood to be stopped, skin to be sewed up, and I just
      did what I could.&rdquo; The mother nodded slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did no more than you ought, and that great Tom Magee might be doing
      something better than lying on his back on the floor like a baby.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He couldn't help himself, mother. That's the way it struck him. But, man,
      it was fine to see the doctor, so quick and so clever, and never a slip or
      a stop.&rdquo; He paused abruptly and stood upright looking far away for some
      moments. &ldquo;Yes, fine! Splendid!&rdquo; he continued as in a dream. &ldquo;And he said I
      had the fingers and the nerve for a surgeon. That's it. I see now&mdash;mother,
      I'm going to be a doctor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His mother stood and faced him. &ldquo;A doctor? You?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sharp tone recalled her son.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, me. Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Richard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her son understood her perfectly. His mind went back to a morning long ago
      when his mother, putting his younger brother's hand in his as they set
      forth to school for the first time, said, &ldquo;Take care of your brother,
      Bernard. I give him into your charge.&rdquo; That very day and many a day after
      he had stood by his brother, had fought for him, had pulled him out of
      scraps into which the younger lad's fiery temper and reckless spirit were
      frequently plunging him, but never once had he consciously failed in the
      trust imposed on him. And as Dick developed exceptional brilliance in his
      school work, together they planned for him, the mother and the older
      brother, the mother painfully making and saving, the brother accepting as
      his part the life of plodding obscurity in order that the younger boy
      might have his full chance of what school and college could do for him.
      True to the best traditions of her race, the mother had fondly dreamed of
      a day when she should hear from her son's lips the word of life. With
      never a thought of the sacrifice she was demanding, she had drawn into
      this partnership her elder son. And thus to the mother it seemed nothing
      less than an act of treachery, amounting to sacrilege, that Barney for a
      single moment should cherish for himself an ambition whose realisation
      might imperil his brother's future. Barney needed, therefore, no
      explanation of his mother's cry of dismay, almost of horror. He was quick
      with his answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dick? Oh, mother, do you think I was forgetting Dick? Of course nothing
      must stop Dick. I can wait&mdash;but I am going to be a doctor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mother looked into her son's rugged face, so like her own in its firm
      lines, and replied almost grudgingly, &ldquo;Ay, I doubt you will.&rdquo; Then she
      added hastily, as if conscious of her ungracious tone, &ldquo;And what for
      should you not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, mother,&rdquo; said her son humbly, &ldquo;and never fear we'll stand by
      Dick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes followed him out of the room and for some moments she stood
      watching the door through which he had passed. Then, with a great sigh,
      she said aloud: &ldquo;Ay, it is the grand doctor he will make. He has the nerve
      and the fingers whatever.&rdquo; Then after a pause she added: &ldquo;And he will not
      fail the laddie, I warrant.&rdquo;

    <h3>
      THE NEW TEACHER
    </h3>
    <p>
      The new teacher was distinctly phenomenal from every point of view. Her
      beauty was a type quite unusual where rosy-cheeked, deep-chested, sturdy
      womanhood was the rule. Even the smallest child was sensible of the
      fascination of her smile, which seemed to emanate from every feature of
      her face, so much so that little Ruby Ross was heard to say: &ldquo;And do you
      know, mother, she smiles with her nose!&rdquo; The almost timid appeal in her
      gentle manner stirred the chivalry latent in every boy's heart. Back of
      her appealing gentleness, however, there was a reserve of proud command
      due to the strain in her blood of a regnant, haughty, slave-ruling race.
      But in her discipline of the school she had rarely to fall back upon sheer
      authority. She had a method unique, but undoubtedly effective, based upon
      two fundamental principles: regard for public opinion, and hope of reward.
      The daily tasks were prepared and rendered as if in the presence of the
      great if somewhat vague public which at times she individualized, as she
      became familiar with her pupils, in the person of father or mother or
      trustee, as the case might be. And with marvellous skill she played this
      string, albeit occasionally she struck a false note.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would your father think, Lincoln?&rdquo; she inquired reproachfully of
      little Link Young. Link's father was a typical Down Easterner, by name
      Jabez Young or, as he was more commonly known, &ldquo;Maine Jabe,&rdquo; for his
      fondness of his reminiscence of his native State. &ldquo;What would your father
      think if he saw you act so rudely?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dad wouldn't care a dang.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Instantly conscious of her mistake, she hastened to recover.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Lincoln, what do you think I think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Link's Yankee assurance sank abashed before this direct personal appeal.
      He hung his head in blushing silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know, Lincoln, you might come to be a right clever gentleman if
      you tried hard.&rdquo; A new idea lodged itself under Link's red thatch of hair
      and a new motive stirred in his shrewd little soul. Here was one visibly
      present whose good opinion he valued. At all costs that good opinion he
      must win.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole school was being consciously trained for exhibition purposes.
      The day would surely come when before the eyes of the public they would
      parade for inspection. Therefore, it behooved them to be ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      But more important in enforcing discipline was the hope of reward. This
      principle was robbed of its more sordid elements by the nature of the
      reward held forth. A day of good conduct and of faithful work invariably
      closed with an hour devoted to histrionic and musical exercise. To recite
      before the teacher and to hear the teacher recite was worth considerable
      effort. To sing with the teacher was a joy, but to hear the teacher sing
      to the accompaniment of her guitar was the supreme of bliss. It was not
      only an hour of pleasure to the pupils, but an hour of training as well.
      She initiated them into the mysteries of deep breathing, chest tones,
      phrasing, and expression, and such was their absorbing interest in and
      devotion to this study, that in a few weeks truly remarkable results were
      obtained. The singing lesson invariably concluded with a plantation song
      from the teacher; and with her memory-gates wide open to the sunny South
      of her childhood, and with all her soul in her voice, she gave them her
      best, holding them breathless, laughterful, or tear-choked, according to
      her mood and song.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was by such a song that Mr. Jabez Young, driving along the road on his
      way to the store, was suddenly arrested and rendered incapable of movement
      till the song was done. In amazed excitement he burst forth to old Hector
      Ross, the Chairman of the Trustee Board, who happened to be in the store:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gol dang my cats! What hev yeh got in the school up yonder? Say! I
      couldn't git my team to move past that there door!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's matter, Mr. Young?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, dang it all! I'll report to the Reeve. Fust thing yeh know there'll
      be a string-a-teams from here to the next concession blockin' that there
      road in front of the school!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what's the matter with the school, Mr. Young?&rdquo; inquired old Hector,
      in anxious surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, ain't ye heard her? Say! down in Maine I paid a dollar one 'time to
      hear a big singer, forgit her name, but she was 'lowed to be the dangdest
      singer in all them parts. But, Gol dang my cats to cinders! she ain't any
      more like that there teacher of yours than my old Tom cat's like the angel
      that leads the choir in Abram's bosom!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is very interesting, Mr. Young. And I suppose you won't mind paying
      a little extra school rate now,&rdquo; said Hector, with a shrewd twinkle in his
      eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Extra school rate! I tell yeh what, I'll charge up my lost time to the
      trustees! But danged if I wouldn't give a day's pay to hear that song
      again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In application of this principle of reward for merit, the teacher
      introduced a subordinate principle which proved effective when all else
      failed. The school was made corporately and jointly responsible for the
      individual. The offence of one was the offence of all, the merit of one
      the merit of all. Thus every pupil was associated with her in the business
      of securing good lessons and exemplary conduct. As the day went on each
      misdemeanour was gravely, and in full view of the school, marked down upon
      the blackboard. The merits obtained by any pupil were in like manner
      recorded. The day closing with an adverse balance knew no hour of song.
      Woe to the boy who, dead to all other motives of good conduct, persisted
      in robbing the school of its hour of delight. In the case of Ab Maddock,
      big, impudent, and pachydermous, it took Dugald Robertson, the minister's
      son, just half an hour's hard fighting to extract a promise of good
      behaviour. Dugald was in the main a thoughtful, peaceable boy, the most
      advanced pupil in the entrance class, and a great mathematician. At first
      he was inclined to despise the teacher, setting little store by her
      beautiful face and fascinating smile, for on the very first day he
      discovered her woful mathematical inadequacy. Arithmetic was her despair.
      With algebraic formulae and Euclid's propositions her fine memory saved
      her. But with quick intuition she threw herself frankly upon the boy's
      generosity, and in the evenings together they, with Margaret's assistance,
      wrestled with the bewildering intricacies of arithmetical problems. Her
      open confession of helplessness, and her heroic attempts to overcome her
      defects, made irresistible appeal to the chivalrous heart of the little
      Highland gentleman. Thenceforth he was her champion for all that was in
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the teacher's weakness in mathematics was atoned for, if atonement
      there be for such a weakness, by the ample strength of her endowments in
      those branches of learning in which imagination and artistic sensibility
      play any large part. And a far larger part, and far more important, do
      these Divine gifts play than many wise educationists conceive. The lessons
      in history, in geography, and in reading ceased to be mere memory tasks
      and became instinct with life. The whole school would stay its ordinary
      work to listen while the teacher told tales of the brave days of old to
      the history class, or transformed the geography lessons into excursions
      among people of strange tongues dwelling in far lands. But it was in the
      reading lessons that her artistic talents had full play. The mere
      pronouncing and spelling of words were but incidents in the way of
      expression of thought and emotion. After a whole week of drilling which
      she would give to a single lesson, she would arrest the class with the
      question, &ldquo;What is the author seeing?&rdquo; and with the further question, &ldquo;How
      does he try to show it to us?&rdquo; Reading, to her, consisted in the ability
      to see what the author saw and the art of telling it, and to set forth
      with grace that thing in the author's words.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the writing class her chief anxiety was to avoid blots. Every blot
      might become an occasion of humiliation to teacher and pupils alike. &ldquo;Oh,
      this will never do! They must not see this!&rdquo; she would cry, rubbing out
      with infinite care and pains the blot, and rubbing in the horror of such a
      defilement being paraded before the eyes of the vague but terrible &ldquo;they.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus the pathway trodden in the school routine was, perchance, neither
      wide nor far extended, but it was thoroughly well trodden. As a
      consequence, when the day for the closing exercises came around both
      teacher and pupils had become so thoroughly familiar with the path and so
      accustomed to the vision of the onlooking public that they faced the
      ordeal without dread, prepared to give forth whatever of knowledge or
      accomplishment they might possess.
    </p>
    <p>
      A fortunate rainy day, making the hauling of hay or the cutting of fall
      wheat equally impossible, filled the school with the parents and friends
      of the children. The minister and the trustees were dutifully present. Of
      the mill people Dick and his mother appeared, Dick because his mother
      insisted that a student should show interest in the school, his mother
      because Dick refused to go a step without her. Barney came later, not
      because of his interest in the school, but chiefly, he declared to
      himself, conscious of the need of a reason, because there was nothing much
      else to do. The presence of &ldquo;Maine&rdquo; Jabe might be taken as the high water
      mark of the interest aroused throughout the section in the new teacher and
      her methods.
    </p>
    <p>
      The closing exercises were, with a single exception, a brilliantly
      flawless exhibition. That exception appeared in the Euclid of the entrance
      class. The mathematics were introduced early in the day. The arithmetic,
      which dealt chiefly with problems of barter and sale of the various
      products of the farm, was lightly and deftly passed over. The algebra
      class was equally successful. In the Euclid class it seemed as if the
      hitherto unbroken success would come to an unhappy end in the bewilderment
      and confusion of Phoebe Ross, from whom the minister had asked a
      demonstration of the pons asinorum. But the blame for poor Phoebe's
      bewilderment clearly lay with the minister himself, for in placing the
      figure upon the board with the letters designating the isosceles triangle
      he made the fatal blunder of setting the letter B at the right hand side
      of the base instead of at its proper place at the left, as in the book.
      The result was that the unhappy Phoebe, ignoring the figure upon the board
      and depending entirely upon her memory, soon plunged both the minister and
      herself into confusion hopeless and complete. But the quick eye of the
      teacher had detected the difficulty, and, going to the board, she erased
      the unfamiliar figure, saying, as she did so, in her gentle appealing
      voice, &ldquo;Wait, Phoebe. You are quite confused, I know. We shall wipe the
      board clean and begin all over.&rdquo; She placed the figure upon the board with
      the designating letters arranged as in the book. &ldquo;Now, take your time,&rdquo;
       she said with deliberate emphasis. &ldquo;Let A, B, C be an isosceles triangle.&rdquo;
       And thus, with her feet set firmly upon the familiar path, little Phoebe
      slipped through that desperate maze of angles and triangles with an ease,
      speed, and dexterity that elicited the wonder and admiration of all
      present, the minister, good man, included. Upon Barney, however, who
      understood perfectly what had happened, the incident left a decidedly
      unpleasant impression. Indeed, the superficiality of the mathematical
      exercises as a whole awakened within him a feeling of pain which he could
      not explain.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the reading classes were under review the school passed from the
      atmosphere of the superficial to that of the real. Never had such reading
      been heard in that or in any other common school. The familiar sing-song
      monotony of the reading lesson was gone and in its place a real and vivid
      picturing of the scenes described or enacted. It was all simple, natural,
      and effective.
    </p>
    <p>
      The exercises attained an easy climax with the recitations and singing
      which closed the day. Here the artistic gifts of the teacher had full
      scope. There was an absence of all nervous dread in the performers. By
      some marvellous power she caught hold and absorbed their attention so that
      for her chiefly, if not entirely, they recited or sang. In the singing,
      which terminated the proceedings, the triumph of the day was complete. A
      single hymn, two or three kindergarten action songs, hitherto unheard in
      that community, a rollicking negro chorus; and, at the last, &ldquo;for the
      children and the mothers,&rdquo; the teacher said, one soft lullaby in which for
      the first time the teacher's voice was heard, the low, vibrant tones
      filling the room with music such as in all their lives they had never
      listened to. It was a fine sense of artistic values that cut out the
      speeches and dismissed the school in the ordinary way. The full tide of
      their enthusiasm broke upon her as minister, trustees, parents, and all
      crowded about her, offering congratulations. Her air of shy grace with
      just a touch of nonchalant reserve served in no small degree to heighten
      the whole effect of the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mill people walked home with the minister and Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn't she a wonder?&rdquo; cried Dick. &ldquo;What has she done to those little
      blocks? Why, they don't seem the same children!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; replied the minister, &ldquo;it is quite surprising, indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In their mathematics, though, there was some thin skating there for a
      while,&rdquo; continued Dick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, the little lassie became confused. But she recovered herself
      cleverly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed,&rdquo; said Dick, with a slight laugh. &ldquo;That was a clever bit of
      work on the part of the teacher.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, shut up, Dick!&rdquo; said Barney sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; replied Dick, &ldquo;no one expects mathematics from a girl,
      anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you hear the conceit of him?&rdquo; said his mother indignantly, &ldquo;and
      Margaret there can show all of you the way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that's true, mother, but Margaret is a wonder, too. But whatever you
      say, the reciting and singing were good. Even little Link Young was quite
      dramatic. They say that 'Maine' Jabe for the first time in his life is
      quite reckless in regard to the school rates.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will just wait a year,&rdquo; said his mother. &ldquo;It is a new broom that
      sweeps clean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, mother, you are too hard to please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; she replied, grimly closing her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they reached the manse gate the minister, who had evidently been
      pondering Dick's words, said, &ldquo;Well, Mrs. Boyle, we have had a delightful
      afternoon, whatever, a remarkable exhibition. Yes, yes. And after all it
      is a great matter that the children should be taught to read and recite
      well. And it was no wonder that the poor thing would seek to make it easy
      for the little girl. And Margaret will need to take Dugald over his
      mathematics, I fear, before he goes up to the entrance.&rdquo; At which remark
      the painful feeling which the reciting and singing had caused Barney to
      forget for the time, returned with even greater poignancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in all the section there was only one opinion, and that was that, at
      all costs, the teacher's services must be retained. For once, the trustees
      realised that no longer would they depend for popularity upon the sole
      qualification of their ability to keep down the school rate. It was,
      perhaps, not the most diplomatic moment they chose for the securing of the
      teacher's services for another year. It might be that they were moved to
      immediate action by the apparent willingness on her part to leave the
      matter of re-engagement an open question. On all hands, however, they were
      applauded as having done a good stroke of business when, there and then,
      they closed their bargain with the teacher, although at a higher salary,
      as it turned out, than had ever been paid in the section before.

    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE YOUNG DOCTOR
    </h3>
    <p>
      Barney's jaw ran along the side of his face, ending abruptly in a
      square-cut chin, the jaw and chin doing for his face what a ridge and
      bluff of rock do for a landscape. They suggested the bed rock of
      character, abiding, firm, indomitable. Having seen the goal at which he
      would arrive, there remained only to find the path and press it. He would
      be a doctor. The question was, how? His first step was to consult the only
      authority available, old Doctor Ferguson. It was a stormy interview, for
      the doctor was of a craggy sort like Barney himself, with a jaw and a chin
      and all they suggested. The boy told his purpose briefly, almost
      defiantly, as if expecting scornful opposition, and asked guidance. The
      doctor flung difficulties at his head for half an hour and ended by
      offering him money, cursing his Highland pride when the boy refused it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do I want with money?&rdquo; cried the doctor. He had lost his only son
      three years before. &ldquo;There's only my wife. And she'll have plenty. Money!
      Dirt, fit to walk on, to make a path with, that's all! Had my boy lived,
      God knows I'd have made him a surgeon. But&mdash;&rdquo; Here the doctor snorted
      violently and coughed, trumpeting hard with his nose. &ldquo;Confound these
      foggy nights! I'll put you through.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll pay my way,&rdquo; said Barney almost sullenly, &ldquo;or I'll stay at home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you doing here, then?&rdquo; he roared at the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came to find out how to start. Must a man go to college?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; shouted the doctor again; &ldquo;he can be a confounded fool and work up
      by himself, a terrible handicap, going up for the examinations till the
      last year, when he must attend college.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could do that,&rdquo; said Barney, closing his jaws.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor looked at his face. The shut jaws looked more than ever like a
      ledge of granite and the chin like a cliff. &ldquo;You can, eh? Hanged if I
      don't believe you! And I'll help you. I'd like to, if you would let me.&rdquo;
       The voice ended in a wistful tone. The boy was touched.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you can!&rdquo; he cried impulsively, &ldquo;and I'll be awfully thankful. You
      can tell me what books to get and sometimes explain, perhaps, if you have
      time.&rdquo; His face went suddenly crimson. He was conscious of asking a
      favour.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old doctor sat down, rejoicing greatly in him, and for the first time
      treated him as an equal. He explained in detail the course of study,
      making much of the difficulties in the way. When he had done he waved his
      hand toward his library.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, there are my books,&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;use them and ask me what you will.
      It will brush me up. And I'll take you to see my cases and, by God's help,
      we'll make you a surgeon! A surgeon, sir! You've got the fingers and the
      nerves. A surgeon! That's the only thing worth while. The physician can't
      see further below the skin than anyone else. He guesses and experiments,
      treats symptoms, trys one drug then another, guessing and experimenting
      all along the line. But the knife, boy!&rdquo; Here the doctor rose and began to
      pace the floor. &ldquo;There's no guess in the knife point! The knife lays bare
      the evil, fights, eradicates it! Look at that boy Kane, died three weeks
      ago. 'Inflammation,' said the physician. Treated his symptoms properly
      enough. The boy died. At the postmortem&rdquo;&mdash;here the doctor paused in
      his walk, lowering his voice almost to a whisper while he bent over the
      boy&mdash;&ldquo;at the post-mortem the knife discovered an abscess on the
      vermiform appendix. The discovery was made too late.&rdquo; These were the days
      before appendicitis became fashionable. &ldquo;Now, listen to me,&rdquo; continued the
      doctor, even more impressively, &ldquo;I believe in my soul that the knife at
      the proper moment might have saved that boy's life! A slight incision an
      inch or two long, the removal of the diseased part, a few stitches, and in
      a couple of weeks the boy is well! Ah, boy! God knows I'd give my life to
      be a great surgeon! But He didn't give me the fingers. Look at these,&rdquo; and
      he held up a coarse, heavy hand; &ldquo;I haven't the touch. And besides, He
      brought me my wife, the best thing I've got in the world, and my baby,
      which settled the surgeon business forever. Now listen, boy! You've got
      the nerve&mdash;plenty of men have that&mdash;but you've also got the
      fingers, which few men have. With your touch and your steady nerve and
      your mechanical ingenuity&mdash;I've seen your machines, boy&mdash;you can
      be a great surgeon! But you must know your subject. You must think, dream,
      sleep, eat, drink bones and muscles and sinews and nerves. Push everything
      else aside!&rdquo; he cried, waving his great hands. &ldquo;And remember!&rdquo;&mdash;here
      his voice took a solemn tone&mdash;&ldquo;let nothing share your heart with your
      knife! Leave the women alone. A woman has no business in science. She
      distracts the mind, disturbs the liver, absorbs the vital powers, besides
      paralysing the finances. For you, let there be one woman, your mother, at
      least till you are a surgeon. Now, then, there are my books and all my
      spare time at your command.&rdquo; At these words the boy's face, which had
      caught the light and glow of the old man's enthusiasm, fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what now?&rdquo; cried the doctor, reading his face like a book.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no right to take your books or your time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor sprang to his feet with an oath. The boy also rose and faced
      him, almost as if expecting a blow. For a moment they stood steadfastly
      regarding each other, then the doctor's old face relaxed, his eyes
      softened. He put his big hand on the boy's shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, by the Lord that made you and me!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we were meant for a
      team, and a team we'll make. I'll help you and I'll make you pay.&rdquo; The
      boy's face brightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo; he cried eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll change work.&rdquo; The doctor's old eyes began to twinkle. &ldquo;I want fall
      ploughing done and my cordwood hauled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll do it!&rdquo; cried Barney. A light broke in his eyes and flooded his
      face. At last he saw his path.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; said the doctor, taking down a book, &ldquo;here's your Gray.&rdquo; And
      turning the leaves, &ldquo;Here's what happened to Ben Fallows. Read this. And
      here's the treatment,&rdquo; pulling down another book and turning to a page,
      &ldquo;Read that. I'll make Ben your first patient. There's no money in it,
      anyway, and you can't kill him. He only needs three things, cleanliness,
      good cheer, and good food. By and by we'll get him a leg. Here's that
      Buffalo doctor's catalogue. Take it along. Now, boy, I'll work you, grind
      you, and you'll go for your first examination next spring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Next spring!&rdquo; cried Barney, aghast, &ldquo;not for three years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three years!&rdquo; snorted the doctor, &ldquo;three fiddlesticks! You can do this
      first examination by next spring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I could do it,&rdquo; said Barney slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor cast an admiring glance at the line of jaw on the boy's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there's the mortgage and there's Dick's college.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dick's college? Why Dick's and not yours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy's rugged face changed. A tender light fell over it, filling in its
      cracks and canyons.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because&mdash;well, because Dick must go through. Dick's clever. He's
      awful clever.&rdquo; Pride mingled with the tenderness in look and tone. &ldquo;Mother
      wants him to be a minister, and,&rdquo; he added after a pause, &ldquo;I do, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old doctor turned from him, stood looking out of the window a few
      minutes, and then came back. He put his hands on the boy's shoulders. &ldquo;I
      understand, boy,&rdquo; he said, his great voice vibrating in deep and tender
      tones, &ldquo;I, too, had a brother once. Make Dick a minister if you want, but
      meantime we'll grind the surgeon's knife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy went home to his mother in high exultation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The doctor wants me to look after Ben for him,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;He is
      going to show me the dressings, and he says all he wants is cleanliness,
      good cheer, and good food. I can keep him clean. But how he is to get good
      cheer in that house, and how he is to get good food, are more than I can
      tell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good cheer!&rdquo; cried Dick. &ldquo;He'll not lack for company. How many has she
      now, mother? A couple of dozen, more or less?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are thirteen of them already, poor thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thirteen! That's an unlucky stopping place. Let us hope she won't allow
      the figure to remain at that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, I am thinking it will not,&rdquo; said his mother, speaking with the
      confidence of intimate knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied Dick, with a judicial air, &ldquo;it's a question whether it's
      worse to defy the fate that lurks in that unlucky number, or to accept the
      doubtful blessing of another twig to the already overburdened olive tree.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, it is a hard time she is having with the four babies and all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Four, mother! Surely that's an unusual number even for the prolific Mrs.
      Fallows!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whisht, laddie!&rdquo; said his mother, in a shocked tone, &ldquo;don't talk
      foolishly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you said four, mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twins the last twice,&rdquo; interjected Barney.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great snakes!&rdquo; cried Dick, &ldquo;let us hope she won't get the habit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, mother,&rdquo; inquired Barney seriously, &ldquo;what's to be done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, I can't tell,&rdquo; said his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to me,&rdquo; cried Dick, &ldquo;I've got an inspiration. I'll undertake the
      'good cheer.' I'll impress the young ladies into this worthy service.
      Light conversation and song. And you can put up the food, mother, can't
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will see,&rdquo; said the mother quietly; &ldquo;we will do our best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case the 'food department' is secure,&rdquo; said Dick; &ldquo;already I see
      Ben Fallows making rapid strides toward convalescence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was characteristic of Barney that within a few days he had all three
      departments in full operation. With great tact he succeeded in making Mrs.
      Fallows thoroughly scour the woodwork and whitewash the walls in Ben's
      little room, urging the doctor's orders and emphasizing the danger of
      microbes, the dread of which was just beginning to obtain in popular
      imagination.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Microbes? What's them?&rdquo; inquired Mrs. Fallows, suspiciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very small insects.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Insects? Is it bugs you mean?&rdquo; Mrs. Fallows at once became fiercely
      hostile. &ldquo;I want to tell yeh, young sir, ther' hain't no bugs in this
      'ouse. If ther's one thing I'm pertickler 'bout, it's bugs. John sez to
      me, sez 'e, 'What's the hodds of a bug or two, Hianthy?' But I sez to 'im,
      sez I, 'No bugs fer me, John. I hain't been brought up with bugs, an' bugs
      I cawn't an' won't 'ave.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was only Barney's earnest assurance that the presence of microbes was
      no impeachment of the most scrupulous housekeeping and, indeed, that these
      mysterious creatures were to be found in the very highest circles, that
      Mrs. Fallows was finally appeased. With equal skill he inaugurated his
      &ldquo;good food&rdquo; department, soothing Mrs. Fallows' susceptibilities with the
      diplomatic information that in surgical cases such as Ben's certain
      articles of diet specially prepared were necessary to the best results.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not the least successful part of the treatment prescribed was that
      furnished by the &ldquo;good cheer&rdquo; department. This was left entirely in Dick's
      charge, and he threw himself into its direction with the enthusiasm of a
      devotee. Iola with her guitar was undoubtedly his mainstay. But Dick was
      never quite satisfied unless he could persuade Margaret, too, to assist in
      his department. But Margaret had other duties, and, besides, she had
      associated herself more particularly with Mrs. Boyle in the work of
      supplementing Mrs. Fallows' somewhat unappetising though entirely
      substantial meals with delicacies more suited to the sickroom. Dick,
      however, insisted that with all that Iola and himself in the &ldquo;good cheer&rdquo;
       department and Barney in what he called the &ldquo;scavenging&rdquo; department could
      achieve, there was still need of Margaret's presence and Margaret's touch.
      Hence, before the busy harvest time came upon them, he made a practice of
      calling at the manse, and, relieving her of the duty of getting to sleep
      little five-year-old Tom, with whom he was first favourite, he would carry
      her off to the Fallows household, whither Barney and Iola had preceded
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Altogether the &ldquo;young doctor,&rdquo; as Ben called him, had reason to be proud
      of the success he was achieving with his first patient. The amputation
      healed over and the bone knit at the first intention, and in a few weeks
      Ben was far on the way to convalescence. He was never weary in his praises
      of the &ldquo;young doctor.&rdquo; It was the &ldquo;young doctor&rdquo; who, by changing the
      bandages, had eased him of the intolerable pain which followed the first
      dressing. It was the &ldquo;young doctor&rdquo; who had changed the splints, shaping
      them cunningly to fit the limb, bringing ease where there had been chafing
      pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let 'em 'ave the old doctor if they want,&rdquo; was Ben's final conclusion,
      &ldquo;but fer me, the young doctor, sez I.&rdquo;

    <h3>
      THE GOOD CHEER DEPARTMENT
    </h3>
    <p>
      The &ldquo;good cheer&rdquo; department, while ostensibly for Ben's benefit, wrought
      profit and cheer for others besides. What Dick got of it no one but
      himself knew, for that young man, with all his apparent frankness, kept
      the veil over his heart drawn close. To Barney, absorbed in his new work,
      with its wealth of new ideas and his new ambitions, the &ldquo;good cheer&rdquo;
       department was chiefly valued as an important factor in Ben's progress. To
      Iola it brought what to her was the breath of life, admiration, gratitude,
      affection. But Margaret perhaps more than any, not even excepting Ben
      himself, gathered from this department what might be called its
      by-products. The daily monotony of her household duties bore hard upon her
      young heart. Ambitions long cherished, though cheerfully laid aside at the
      sudden call of duty, could not be quite abandoned without a sense of pain
      and loss. The break offered by the work of the department in the monotony
      of her life, the companionship of its members, and, as much as anything,
      the irresistible appeal to her keen sense of humour by the genial,
      loquacious, dirty but irresistibly cheery Mrs. Fallows, far more than
      compensated for the extra effort which her membership in the department
      rendered necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the evening following that of the school closing that Dick with
      Margaret and Iola were making one of their customary calls at the Fallows
      cottage. It would be for Iola the last visit for some weeks, as she was
      about to depart to town for her holidays.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have come to say good-bye,&rdquo; she announced as she shook hands with Mrs.
      Fallows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, dear 'eart,&rdquo; said that lady, throwing up her hands aghast; &ldquo;art
      goin' to leave us fer good?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, nothing so bad,&rdquo; said Dick; &ldquo;only for a few weeks, Mrs. Fallows. The
      section couldn't do without her, and the trustees have decided that they
      wouldn't let her out of sight till they had put a string on her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goin' to come back again, be yeh? I did 'ear as 'ow yeh was goin' to
      leave. My little Joe was that broken-'earted, an' 'e declared to me as 'ow
      'e wouldn't go to school no more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't wonder,&rdquo; said Dick. &ldquo;Why, if the trustees hadn't engaged her, as
      'Maine Jabe' said, 'there'd be the dangdest kind of riot in the section.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't listen to him, Mrs. Fallows. I'm going in to sing to Ben, if I
      may.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' that yeh may, bless yer 'eart!&rdquo; said Mrs. Fallows, picking up a twin
      from the doorway to allow Iola and Dick to pass into the inner room.
      &ldquo;Ther' now,&rdquo; she continued to Margaret, who was moving about putting
      things to rights, &ldquo;don't yeh go tirin' of yerself. I know things is in a
      muss. Some'ow by Saturday night things piles up terr'ble, an' I'm that
      tired I don't seem to 'ave no 'eart to straighten 'em up. Jest look at
      that 'ouse! I sez to John, sez I, 'I cawn't do no 'ousekeepin' with all
      'em children 'bout my feet. An', bless their 'earts! it's all I kin do to
      put the bread in their mouths an keep the rags on their backs.' But John
      sez to me, sez 'e, 'Don't yeh worry, lass, 'bout the rags. Keep 'em full,'
      sez 'e, 'a full belly never 'eeds a bare back,' sez 'e. That's 'is way.
      'E's halways a-comin' over somethin' cleverlike, is John. Lard save us!
      will yeh listen to that, now!&rdquo; she continued in an awestruck undertone, as
      Iola's voice came in full rich melody from the next room. &ldquo;An' Ben is fair
      raptured with 'er. Poor Benny! it's a sore calamity 'as overtaken 'im,
      a-breakin' of 'is leg an' a-mutilatin' of 'isself. It does seem as if the
      Lard 'ad give me som'at more'n my share. Listen to that ther'. Bless 'er
      dear 'eart; Benny fergits 'is hamputation an' 'is splits.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His splints,&rdquo; cried Margaret; &ldquo;are they all right now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Since the young doctor&mdash;that's w'at Benny calls 'im&mdash;change
      'em. Oh, that's a clever young man! Benney, 'e sez, 'Give me the young
      doctor,' sez 'e. Yeh see,&rdquo; continued Mrs. Fallows confidentially, and
      again lowering her voice impressively, &ldquo;yeh see, 'is leg 'urt most orful
      at first, an' Benny cried to me, 'It's in me toes, mother, it's in me
      toes.' 'Why, Benny,' sez I to 'im, 'yeh hain't got no toes, Benny.'
      'That's w'ere it 'urts,' sez 'e, 'toes or no toes.' An' father 'e wakes
      right up an' 'erd w'at Benny was cryin', an' sez 'e, 'Benny's right
      enough. 'Is toes'll 'urt till they're rotted away in the ground.' An' 'e
      tells as 'ow 'is sister's holdest boy got 'is leg hamputated, poor soul!
      an' 'ow 'is toes 'urted till they was took an' buried an' rotted away.
      Some doctors don't bury 'em, an' they do say,&rdquo; and here Mrs. Fallows'
      voice dropped quite to a whisper, &ldquo;as 'ow that keeps 'em sore all the
      longer. Well, jest as father was speakin' in comes the doctor 'isself, an'
      father 'e told 'im as 'ow Benny was feelin' the pain in 'is toes. 'In yer
      toes, Benny?' sez the doctor surprised-like. 'Tain't yer toes, Ben.'
      'Well, I guess it's me as is doin' the feelin',' sez Ben quite sharp, 'an'
      it's in me toes the feelin' is.' Then father 'e spoke up. 'E's a terr'ble
      man fer hargument, is father. 'Doctor,' sez 'e, 'is them toes buried, if I
      might be so bold?' 'Cawn't say,' sez the doctor quite hindifferent, though
      'e must 'a' knowed. 'Well, my opinion is,' sez father, ''e'll feel them
      toes till they're took an' buried an' rotted away in the ground.' An' then
      'e tells 'bout 'is sister's boy. 'Nonsense,' sez the doctor, 'tain't 'is
      toes at all. 'Is toes 'as nothin' to do with it.' 'W'at then?' asks father
      quite polite. 'It's the feelin' of 'is toes 'e's feelin'.' ''Ow can 'e
      'ave any feelin' of 'is toes if 'e hain't got no toes?' 'Well,' sez the
      doctor, ''is feelin's hain't in 'is toes at all.' 'Well, that's w'ere mine
      is,' sez father. 'W'en I 'urts my toes it's in my toes I feel 'em. W'en I
      'urts my 'and, it's my 'and.' 'My dear sir,' sez the doctor calm-like, 'it
      hain't in yer 'and, nor yet in yer toes, but in yer brain, in yer mind,
      yeh feel the pain.' 'P'raps,' sez Ben quite short again. My! 'e WAS short!
      'But the feelin' in my mind is that my toes is 'urtin' most orful, an' I'd
      like to 'ave 'em buried if it's goin' to 'elp any.' 'Oh, come, Benny,
      that's all nonsense, yeh know,' sez the doctor, puttin' 'im off. But
      father is terr'ble persistent, an' 'e keeps on an' sez, 'Don't 'is mind
      know 'e hain't got no toes, doctor? 'Ow can 'is mind feel 'is toes 'urt
      w'en 'is mind knows 'e hain't got no toes to 'urt?' 'It hain't 'is toes, I
      tell yeh,' sez the doctor quite short, 'jest the feelin' of 'is toes in
      'is mind.' 'The feelin' of 'is toes in 'is mind?' sez father. 'But 'e
      hain't got no toes to give 'im the feelin' of 'is toes in 'is mind or
      henywheres else.' 'Dummed old fool!' sez the doctor, quite losin' 'is
      temper, fer father is terr'ble provokin'. 'It's the feelin' 'is toes used
      to give 'im, an' that same feelin' of toes keeps up after 'is toes is
      gone.' 'Well,' sez father, an' me tryin' to ketch 'is eye to make 'im
      stop, 'I don't git no feelin' of toes till me toes is 'urt. If I don't
      'urt 'em, I don't git no feelin' of toes. 'Ow are yeh goin' to start that
      ther' toe feelin' 'thout no toes to start it?' 'Yeh don't need no toes to
      start it,' sez the doctor, 'it's the old feelin' of toes a-keepin' up.'
      'Ther' hain't no&mdash;' 'Look 'ere,' sez 'e, 'I tell yeh it hain't toes,
      it's the nerves of the toes reachin' up to the brain. Don't yeh see? W'en
      the toes are 'urt the nerves sends word up to the brain jest like the
      telegraph.' Then father 'e ponders aw'ile. 'W'ere's them nerves, doctor?'
      sez 'e. 'In the toes.' 'In the toes? Then w'en them toes is gone them
      nerves is gone, hain't they?' 'Yes.' 'But the nerve feelin' is ther'
      still.' This puzzles father some. 'Then,' sez 'e, 'the feelin's in the
      nerves, an' if ther's no nerves, no feelin's.' 'That's so,' sez the
      doctor. 'W'en them toes is gone, doctor, the nerves is gone. 'Ow could
      ther' be any feelin's?' 'Look 'ere,' sez the doctor, an' I was feared 'e
      was gettin' real mad, 'jest quit it right now.' 'Well, well. All right,
      doctor,' sez father quite polite, 'I've got a terr'ble inquirin' mind, an'
      I jest wanted to know.' Then the doctor 'e did seem a little ashamed of
      'isself, an' 'e set right down an' sez 'e, 'Look a-'ere, Mr. Fallows, I'll
      hexplain it to yeh. It's like the telegraph wire. 'Ere's a station we'll
      call Bradford, an' 'ere's a station we'll call London. Hevery station 'as
      'is own call. Bradford station, we'll say, 'as a call X Y Z, an' w'enever
      X Y Z sounds yeh know that's Bradford a-speakin'. So if yeh 'eerd X Y Z in
      London yeh'd know somethin' was wrong with Bradford.' 'But if ther' hain't
      any,' breaks in father, who was gettin' impatient. 'Shut up! will yeh?'
      sez the doctor, 'till I git through. Well; all 'long that Bradford line
      yeh can give that Bradford call. D'yeh see?' 'Can yeh make that Bradford
      call houtside of Bradford?' sez father. 'Well,' sez the doctor, an' 'e
      seemed quite puzzled, 'e did, 'I suppose yeh can. Any kind of a bang'll do
      along the line. Now ther's Benny's toes, w'en they git 'urt they sounds up
      to the brain, &ldquo;Toes! Toes! Toes!&rdquo; an' all 'long that toe line yeh can git
      the same call to the brain.' This keeps father quiet a long time, then sez
      'e, 'I say, doctor, is ther' many of them nerves?' ''Undreds of 'em.'
      'Hevery part of the body got nerves?' 'Yes.' 'Hankles? calves? shins?'
      'Yes, all got nerves.' 'Well, doctor,' sez father, quite triumphant, 'w'en
      yeh cut through hankles, shins, an' heverythin', all them nerves begin to
      shout, don't they?' 'Yes,' sez the doctor, not seein' w'ere father was at.
      'Then,' sez 'e quick-like, 'w'at makes 'em all shout &ldquo;Toes?&rdquo; W'y don't the
      brain 'ear &ldquo;Hankle&rdquo; or &ldquo;'Eel&rdquo;?' Then the old doctor 'e did git mad an' 'e
      did swear at father most orful. But father, 'e knows 'ow to conduct
      'isself, an' sez 'e quite dignified, 'I 'ope as 'ow I know 'ow to treat a
      gentleman.' This pulls the old doctor up an' 'e sez, 'I beg yer pardon,
      Mr. Fallows,' sez 'e. 'Don't mention it,' sez father. Then the doctor went
      on quite nice, 'Yeh see, Mr. Fallows, the truth is, we don't hunderstand
      these things very well,' sez 'e. 'Well, doctor,' sez father, 'it would 'a'
      saved a lot of trouble if yeh'd said so at the first.' An' 'e said no
      more, but I seed 'im thinkin' 'ard, an' w'en the doctor was goin' 'e
      speaks up sez, sez 'e, 'I think I know w'y it's the shoutin' of toes keeps
      up an' not 'eels or hankles,' sez 'e. 'W'en my thirteen gits a-shoutin' in
      this little 'ouse, yeh cawn't 'ear the old woman or me. Ther's thirteen of
      'em. An' I suppose w'en them toes gits a-shoutin' yeh cawn't 'ear nothin'
      of hankle, or 'eel, but it's all toes. Ther's five to one. But, doctor,'
      'e sez, as 'e druv' away, 'if it's not too bold, would yeh mind buryin'
      them toes?'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Mrs. Fallows, pulling herself up, &ldquo;I do talk. But poor Benny,
      'e kep' a-cryin' with 'is toes till that ther' blessed young lady come,
      the young doctor fetched 'er, an' the minit she begin to sing, poor Benny
      'e fergits 'is toes an' 'e soon falls off to sleep, the first 'e 'ad fer
      two days an' two nights. Poor dear! An 'e hain't ever done talkin' 'bout
      that very young lady an' the young doctor. An' a lovely pair they'd make,
      poor souls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret was conscious of a sudden pang at this grouping of names by Mrs.
      Fallows, but before she had time to analyse her feelings Iola reappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, good-bye,&rdquo; said Mrs. Fallows. &ldquo;Yeh'll come agin w'en yeh git back.
      Good-bye, Miss,&rdquo; she said to Margaret. &ldquo;It does seem to give me a fresh
      start w'en yeh put things to rights.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was not till that night when she was in her own room preparing for bed
      that Margaret had time to analyse that sudden pang.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It can't be that I am jealous,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Of course, she is far more
      attractive than I am and why shouldn't everyone like her better?&rdquo; She
      shook her fist at her reflection in the glass. &ldquo;Do you know, you are as
      mean as you can be,&rdquo; she said viciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment there came from Iola's room the sound of soft singing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's no wonder,&rdquo; said Margaret as she listened to the exquisite sound,
      &ldquo;it's no wonder that she could catch poor Ben and his mother with a voice
      like that. Yes, and&mdash;and the rest of them, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a few minutes there was a tap at her door and Iola came in, her hair
      hanging like a dusky curtain about her face. Margaret uttered an
      involuntary exclamation of admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My! you are lovely!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;No wonder everyone loves you.&rdquo; With a
      sudden rush of penitent feeling for her &ldquo;mean thoughts&rdquo; she put her arms
      about Iola and kissed her warmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lovely! Nonsense!&rdquo; she exclaimed, surprised at this display of affection
      so unusual for Margaret, &ldquo;I am not half so lovely as you. When I see you
      at home here with all the things to worry you and the children to care
      for, I think you are just splendid and I feel myself cheap and worthless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret was conscious of a grateful glow in her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, my work doesn't amount to much, washing and dusting and mending.
      Anybody could do it. No one would ever notice me. Wherever you go the
      people just fall down and worship you.&rdquo; As she spoke she let down her hair
      preparatory to brushing it. It fell like a cloud, a golden-yellow cloud,
      about her face and shoulders. Iola looked critically at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are beautiful,&rdquo; she said slowly. &ldquo;Your hair is lovely, and your big
      blue eyes, and your face has something, what is it? I can't tell you. But
      I believe people would come to you in difficulty. Yes. That's it,&rdquo; she
      continued, with her eyes on Margaret's face, &ldquo;I can please them in a way.
      I can sing. Yes, I can sing. Some day I shall make people listen. But
      suppose I couldn't sing, suppose I lost my voice, people would forget me.
      They wouldn't forget you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What nonsense!&rdquo; said Margaret brusquely. &ldquo;It is not your voice alone; it
      is your beauty and something I cannot describe, something in your manner
      that is so fetching. At any rate, all the young fellows are daft about
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the women don't care for me,&rdquo; said Iola, with the same slow,
      thoughtful voice. &ldquo;If I wanted very much I believe I could make them. But
      they don't. There's Mrs. Boyle, she doesn't like me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you're talking nonsense,&rdquo; said Margaret impatiently. &ldquo;You ought to
      have heard old Mrs. Fallows this evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; continued Iola, ignoring her remark, &ldquo;the women all like you, and
      the men, too, in a way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't talk nonsense,&rdquo; said Margaret impatiently. &ldquo;When you're around the
      boys don't look at me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, they do,&rdquo; said Iola, as if pondering the question. &ldquo;Ben does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret laughed scornfully. &ldquo;Ben likes my jelly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Dick does,&rdquo; continued Iola, &ldquo;and Barney.&rdquo; Here she shot a keen glance
      at Margaret's face. Margaret caught the glance, and, though enraged at
      herself, she could not prevent a warm flush spreading over her fair cheek
      and down her bare neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo; she cried angrily, &ldquo;those boys! Of course, they like me. I've
      known them ever since I was a baby. Why, I used to go swimming with them
      in the pond. They think of me just like&mdash;well&mdash;just like a boy,
      you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think so? They are nice boys, I think, that is, if they had a
      chance to be anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be anything!&rdquo; cried Margaret hotly. &ldquo;Why, Dick's going to be a minister
      and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Dick will do something, though he'll make a funny clergyman. But
      Barney, what will he be? Just a miller?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miller or whatever he is, he'll be a man, and that's good enough,&rdquo;
       replied Margaret indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, I suppose so. But it's a pity. You know in this pokey little
      place no one will ever hear of him. I mean he'll never make any stir.&rdquo; To
      Iola there was no crime so deadly as the &ldquo;unheard of.&rdquo; &ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; she went
      on, &ldquo;if he had a chance&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Margaret could bear this no longer. &ldquo;What are you talking about? There
      are plenty of good men who are never heard of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; cried Iola quickly, &ldquo;I didn't mean&mdash;of course your father.
      Well, your father is a gentle man. But Barney&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, go to bed! Come, get out of my room. Go to bed! I must get to sleep.
      Seven o'clock comes mighty quick. Good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't be cross, Margaret. I didn't mean to say anything offensive. And I
      want you to love me. I think I want everyone to love me. I can't bear to
      have people not love me. But more than anyone else I want you.&rdquo; As she
      spoke she turned impulsively toward Margaret and put her arms around her
      neck. Margaret relented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I love you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;There,&rdquo; kissing her, &ldquo;good-night. Go to
      sleep or you'll lose your beauty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Iola clung to her. &ldquo;Good-night, dear Margaret,&rdquo; she said, her lips
      trembling pathetically. &ldquo;You are the only girl friend I ever had. I
      couldn't bear you to forget me or to give up loving me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never forget my friends,&rdquo; cried Margaret gravely. &ldquo;And I never cease to
      love them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Margaret!&rdquo; said Iola, trembling and clinging fast to her, &ldquo;don't turn
      from me. No matter what comes, don't stop loving me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You little goose,&rdquo; cried Margaret, caressing her as if she were a child,
      &ldquo;of course I will always love you. Good-night now.&rdquo; She kissed Iola
      tenderly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night,&rdquo; said Iola. &ldquo;You know this is my last night with you for a
      long time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not the very last,&rdquo; said Margaret. &ldquo;We go to the Mill to-morrow night,
      you remember, and you come back here with me. Barney is going to have Ben
      there for nursing and feeding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Next day Barney had Ben down to the Mill, and that was the beginning of a
      new life to Ben in more ways than one. The old mill became a place of
      interest and delight to him. Perhaps his happiest hours were spent in what
      was known as Barney's workroom, where were various labour-saving machines
      for churning, washing, and apple-paring, which, by Barney's invention,
      were run by the mill power. He offered to connect the sewing machine with
      the same power, but his mother would have none of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before many more weeks had gone Ben was hopping about by the aid of a
      crutch, eager to make himself useful, and soon he was not only &ldquo;paying his
      board,&rdquo; as Barney declared, but &ldquo;earning good wages as well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The early afternoon found Margaret and Iola on their way to the Mill. It
      was with great difficulty that Margaret had been persuaded to leave her
      home for so long a time. The stern conscience law under which she
      regulated her life made her suspect those things which gave her peculiar
      pleasure, and among these was a visit to the Mill and the Mill people. It
      was in vain that Dick set before her, with the completeness amounting to
      demonstration, the reasons why she should make that visit. &ldquo;Ben needs
      you,&rdquo; he argued. &ldquo;And Iola will not come unless with you. Barney and I,
      weary with our day's work, absolutely require the cheer and refreshment of
      your presence. Mother wants you. I want you. We all want you. You must
      come.&rdquo; It was Mrs. Boyle's quiet invitation and her anxious entreaty and
      command that she should throw off the burden at times, that finally
      weighed with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hours of that afternoon, spent partly in rowing about in the old
      flat-bottomed boat seeking water lilies in the pond, and partly in the
      shade of the big willows overlooking the dam, were full of restful delight
      to Margaret. It was one of those rare summer evenings that fall in harvest
      weather when, after the burning heat of the day, the cool air is beginning
      to blow across the fields with long shadows. When their work was done the
      boys hurried to join the little group under the big willows. They were all
      there. Ben was set there in the big armchair, Mrs. Boyle with her
      knitting, for there were no idle hours for her, Margaret with a book which
      she pretended to read, old Charley smoking in silent content, Iola lazily
      strumming her guitar and occasionally singing in her low, rich voice some
      of her old Mammy's songs or plantation hymns. Of these latter, however,
      Mrs. Boyle was none too sure. To her they bordered dangerously on
      sacrilege; nor did she ever quite fully abandon herself to delight in the
      guitar. It continued to be a &ldquo;foreign&rdquo; and &ldquo;feckless&rdquo; sort of instrument.
      But in spite of her there were times when the old lady paused in her
      knitting and sat with sombre eyes looking far across the pond and into the
      shady isles of the woods on the other side while Iola sang some of her
      quaint Southern &ldquo;baby songs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Under Dick's tuition the girl learned some of the Highland laments and
      love songs of the North, to which his mother had hushed him to sleep
      through his baby years. To Barney these songs took place with the Psalms
      of David, if, indeed, they were not more sacred, and it was with a shock
      at first that he heard the Southern girl with her &ldquo;foreign instrument&rdquo; try
      over these songs that none but his mother had ever sung to him. Listening
      to Iola's soft, thrilling voice carrying these old Highland airs, he was
      conscious of a strange incongruity. They undoubtedly took on a new beauty,
      but they lost something as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one sings them like your mother, Barney,&rdquo; said Margaret after Dick had
      been drilling Iola on some of their finer shadings and cadences, &ldquo;and they
      are quite different with the guitar, too. They are not the same a bit.
      They make me see different things and feel different things when your
      mother sings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Different how?&rdquo; said Dick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't tell, but somehow they give me a different taste in my mouth,
      just the difference between eating your mother's scones with rich creamy
      milk and eating fruit cake and honey with tea to drink.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said Barney gravely. &ldquo;They lose the Scotch with the guitar. They
      are sweet and beautiful, wonderful, but they are a different kind
      altogether. To me it's the difference between a wood violet and a garden
      rose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to the poetry of him. Come, mother,&rdquo; cried Dick, &ldquo;sing us one
      now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me sing!&rdquo; cried the mother aghast. &ldquo;After yon!&rdquo; nodding toward Iola. &ldquo;You
      would not be shaming your mother, Richard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shaming you, indeed!&rdquo; cried Margaret, indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do, Mrs. Boyle,&rdquo; entreated Iola. &ldquo;I have never heard you sing. Indeed, I
      did not know you could sing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Something in her voice grated upon Barney's ear, but he spoke no word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sing!&rdquo; cried Dick. &ldquo;You ought to hear her. Now, mother, for the honor of
      the heather! Give us 'Can Ye Sew Cushions?' That's a 'baby song,' too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Barney quietly, &ldquo;Sing 'The Mac'Intosh,' mother.&rdquo; And he began
      to play that exquisite Highland lament.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not her son's entreaty so much as something in the soft drawl of
      the Southern girl that made Mrs. Boyle yield. Something in that tone
      touched the pride in the old lady's Highland blood. When Barney reached
      the end of the refrain his mother took up the verse with the violin
      accompanying.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her voice lacked fulness and power. It was worn and thin, but she had the
      exquisite lilting note of the Highland maids at their milking or of the
      fisher folk at the mending of their nets. Clear and sweet and with a
      penetrating pathos indescribable, the voice rose and fell in all the
      quaint turns and quavers and cadences that a tune takes on with age. As
      she sang her song in the soft Gaelic tongue, with hands lying idly in her
      lap, with eyes glowing in their gloomy depths, the spell of mountain and
      glen and loch fell upon her sons and upon the girl seated at her feet,
      while Iola's great lustrous eyes, fastened upon the stranger's face,
      softened to tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that is too lovely!&rdquo; cried Iola, when the song was done, clapping her
      hands. &ldquo;No, not lovely. That is not the word. Sad, sad.&rdquo; She hid her face
      in her hands one impulsive moment, then said softly, &ldquo;I could never do
      that. Never! Never! What is it you put into the song? What is it?&rdquo; she
      cried, turning to Barney.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's the moan of the sea,&rdquo; said Barney gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It gives a feller a kind of holler pain inside,&rdquo; said Ben Fallows. &ldquo;There
      hain't no words fer it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sing again,&rdquo; entreated Iola, all the lazy indifference gone from her
      voice. &ldquo;Sing just one more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This one, mother,&rdquo; said Barney, playing the tune, &ldquo;your mother used to
      sing, you know, 'Fhir a Bhata'.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;How often haunting the highest hilltop,
      I scan the ocean thy sail to see;
      Wilt come to-night, Love? wilt come to-morrow?
      Wilt ever come, love, to comfort me?
               Fhir a bhata, na horo eile,
               Fhir a bhata, na horo eile,
               Fhir a bhata, na horo eile,
               O fare ye well, love, where'er ye be.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      For some moments they sat quiet with the spell of the dreamy, sad music
      upon them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One more, mother,&rdquo; entreated Dick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, laddie. The night is falling. There's work to-morrow for you. Aye,
      and for Margaret here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Iola rose and came timidly to Mrs. Boyle. &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; she said, lifting
      up her great, dark eyes to the old woman's face, &ldquo;you have given me great
      pleasure to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, and you're welcome, lassie,&rdquo; said Mrs. Boyle, smitten with a
      sudden pity for the motherless girl. &ldquo;And we will be glad to see ye when
      ye come back again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For this, too, it was that Iola as well as Margaret could never forget
      that afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, ladies and gentlemen,&rdquo; cried Dick, striking an attitude, &ldquo;though
      the 'good cheer' department may seem to have accomplished the purpose for
      which it was organised, it cannot be said to have outlived its usefulness,
      in that it appears to have created for itself a sphere of operations from
      which it cannot be withdrawn without injury to all its members. I,
      therefore, respectfully suggest that the department be organised upon a
      permanent basis with headquarters at the Mill and my humble self at its
      head. All who agree will say 'Aye'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; said Barney with prompt heartiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me, too,&rdquo; cried Iola, holding up both hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother, what do you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye, laddie. There's much need for good cheer in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you?&rdquo; turning to Margaret, who stood with Mrs. Boyle's arm thrown
      about her, &ldquo;how do you vote?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This member needs it too much&rdquo;&mdash;with a somewhat uncertain smile&mdash;&ldquo;to
      say anything but 'Aye'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Dick solemnly, &ldquo;the 'good cheer' department is hereby and
      henceforth organised as a permanent institution in the community here
      represented, and we earnestly hope that its members will continue in their
      faithful adherence thereto, believing, as we do, that loyalty to this
      institution will be its highest reward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But none of them knew what potencies of joy and of pain lay wrapped up for
      them all in that same department of &ldquo;good cheer.&rdquo;

    <h3>
      BEN'S GANG
    </h3>
    <p>
      The harvest time in Ontario is ever a season of delightful rush and
      bustle. The fall wheat follows hard upon the haying, and close upon the
      fall wheat comes the barley, then the oats and the rest of the spring
      grain.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was this year to be a more than usually busy time for the Boyle boys.
      They had a common purse, and out of that purse the payments on the
      mortgage must be met, as well as Dick's college expenses. For the little
      farm, with the profits from the mill, could do little more than provide a
      living for the family. Ordinarily the lads worked for day's wages, the
      farmers gladly paying the highest going, for the boys were famous binders
      and good workers generally. This year, however, they had in mind something
      more ambitious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; said Dick, &ldquo;did you hear of the new harvesting gang?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who might they be?&rdquo; asked his mother, always on the lookout for some
      nonsense from her younger son.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boyle and Fallows&mdash;or Fallows and Boyle, I guess it will be. Ben's
      starting with us Monday morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense, laddie. There will be no reaping for Ben this year, I doubt,
      poor fellow; and, besides, I will be needing him for myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. But I am in earnest, mother. Ben is to drive the reaper for us. He
      can sit on the reaper half a day, you know. At least, his doctor here says
      so. And he will keep us busy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I cawn't keep the two of you a-humpin', though you are some pumpkins
      at bindin', I hain't worth my feed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Barney,&rdquo; remonstrated his mother, &ldquo;is he fit to go about that
      machine? Something might happen the lad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think there is any danger, mother. And, besides, we will be at
      hand all the time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what will two lads like you do following the machine all day? You
      will only be hurting yourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You watch us, mother,&rdquo; cried Dick. &ldquo;We'll be after Ben like a dog after a
      coon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; said his mother. &ldquo;I have heard that it takes four good men to
      keep up to a machine. It was no later than yesterday that Mr. Morrison's
      Sam was telling me that they had all they could do to follow up, the whole
      four of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; grunted Dick scornfully, &ldquo;I suppose so. Four like Fatty Morrison
      and that gang of his!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, laddie. It is not good to be speaking ill of your neighbours,&rdquo; said
      his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's not speaking ill to say that a man is fat. It's a very fine
      compliment, mother. Only wish someone could say the same of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, and you would be the better of it,&rdquo; replied his mother
      compassionately, &ldquo;with your bones sticking through your skin!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was with the spring crop that Ben Fallows began his labours; and much
      elevated, indeed, was he at the prospect of entering into partnership with
      the Boyle boys, who were renowned for the very virtues which poor Ben
      consciously lacked and to which, in the new spirit that was waking in him,
      he was beginning to aspire. For the weeks spent under Barney's care and
      especially in the atmosphere of the Mill household had quickened in Ben
      new motives and new ambitions. This Barney had noticed, and it was for
      Ben's sake more than for their own that the boys had associated him with
      them in their venture of taking harvesting contracts. And as the summer
      went on they found no reason to regret the new arrangement. But it was at
      the expense of long days and hard days for the two boys following the
      reaper, and often when the day's work was done they could with difficulty
      draw their legs home and to bed. Indeed, there were nights when Dick,
      hardly the equal of his brother in weight and strength, lay sleepless from
      sheer exhaustion, while Barney from sympathy kept anxious vigil with him.
      Morning, however, found them stiff and sore, it is true, but full of
      courage and ready for the renewal of the long-drawn struggle which was
      winning for them not only very substantial financial profits, but also
      high fame as workers. The end of the harvest found them hard, tough, full
      of nerve and fit for any call within the limit of their powers. It was Ben
      who furnished the occasion of such a call being made upon them. A rainy
      day found him at the blacksmith shop with the Mill team waiting to be
      shod. The shop was full of horses and men. A rainy day was a harvest day
      for the blacksmith. All odd jobs allowed to accumulate during the fine
      weather were on that day brought to the shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ben, with his crutch and his wooden leg, found himself the centre of a new
      interest and sympathy. In spite of the sympathy, however, there was a
      disposition to chaff poor Ben, whose temper was brittle, and whose tongue
      took on a keener edge as his temper became more uncertain. Withal, he had
      a little man's tendency to brag. To-day, however, though conscious of the
      new interest centring in him, and though visibly swollen with the
      importance of his new partnership with the Boyle boys, he was exhibiting a
      dignity and self-control quite unusual, and was, for that very reason,
      provocative of chaff more pungent than ordinary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chief among his tormenters was Sam Morrison, or &ldquo;Fatty&rdquo; Morrison, as he
      was colloquially designated. Sam was one of four sons of &ldquo;Old King&rdquo;
       Morrison, the richest and altogether most important farmer in the
      district. On this account Samuel was inclined to assume the blustering
      manners of his portly, pompous, but altogether good-natured father, the
      &ldquo;Old King.&rdquo; But while bluster in the old man, who had gained the respect
      and esteem that success generally brings, was tolerated, in Sammy it
      became ridiculous and at times offensive. The young man had been
      entertaining the assembled group of farmers and farm lads with vivid
      descriptions of various achievements in the harvest field on the part of
      himself or some of the members of his distinguished family, the latest and
      most notable achievement being the &ldquo;slashing down and tying up&rdquo; of a
      ten-acre field of oats by the four of them, the &ldquo;Old King&rdquo; himself driving
      the reaper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir!&rdquo; shouted Sammy. &ldquo;And Joe, he took the last sheaf right off that
      table! You bet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How many of you?&rdquo; asked Ben sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just four,&rdquo; replied Sammy, turning quickly at Ben's unexpected question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How many shocking?&rdquo; continued Ben, with a judicial air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, none, you blamed gander! An' kep' us humpin', too, you bet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess so,&rdquo; grunted Ben, &ldquo;from what I've seed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sam regarded him steadfastly. &ldquo;And what have you 'seed,' Mr. Fallows, may
      I ask?&rdquo; he inquired with fine scorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seed? Seed you bindin', of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what are ye hootin' about?&rdquo; Sam was exceedingly wroth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hain't been talking much for the last hour.&rdquo; In moments of excitement
      Ben became uncertain of his h's. &ldquo;I used to talk more when I wasn't so
      busy, but I hain't been talkin' so much this 'ere 'arvest. We hain't had
      time. When we're on a job,&rdquo; continued Ben, as the crowd drew near to
      listen, &ldquo;we hain't got time fer talkin', and when we're through we don't
      feel like it. We don't need, to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A general laugh of approval followed Ben's words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're right, Ben. You're a gang of hustlers,&rdquo; said Alec Murray. &ldquo;There
      ain't much talkin' when you git a-goin'. But that's a pretty good day's
      work, Ben, ten acres.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ben gave a snort. &ldquo;Yes. Not a bad day's work fer two men.&rdquo; He had no love
      for any of the Morrisons, whose near neighbours he was and at whose hands
      he had suffered many things.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two men!&rdquo; shouted Sammy. &ldquo;Your gang, I suppose you mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Ben's self-control vanished. &ldquo;Yes, by the jumpin' Jemima!&rdquo; he
      cried, facing suddenly upon Sam. &ldquo;Them's the two, if yeh want to know.
      Them's binders! They don't stop, at hevery corner to swap lies an' to see
      if it's goin' to ran. They keep a-workin', they do. They don't wait to
      cool hoff before they drink fer fear they git foundered, as if they was
      'osses, like you fellers up on the west side line there.&rdquo; Ben threw his
      h's recklessly about. &ldquo;You hain't no binders, you hain't. Yeh never seed
      any.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment &ldquo;King&rdquo; Morrison himself entered the blacksmith shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Ben! What's eatin' you?&rdquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ben grew suddenly quiet. &ldquo;Makin' a bloomin' hass of myself, I guess,&rdquo; he
      growled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's up with Benny? He seems a little raised,&rdquo; said the &ldquo;Old King,&rdquo;
       addressing the crowd generally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, blowin' 'bout his harvestin' gang,&rdquo; said his son Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you can do a little blowin' yourself, Sammy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guess I came by it natcherly n'ough,&rdquo; said Sam. He stood in no awe of his
      father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blowin's all right if you can back it up, Sammy. But what's the matter,
      Benny, my boy? We're all glad to see you about, an' more'n that, we're
      glad to hear of your good work this summer. But what are they doin' to
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doin' nothin',&rdquo; broke in Sam, a little nettled at the &ldquo;Old King's&rdquo; kindly
      tone toward Ben. &ldquo;He's blowin' round here to beat the band 'bout his
      gang.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Sam, he's got a right to blow, for they're two good workers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they can't bind ten acres a day, as Ben blows about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that would be a little strong,&rdquo; said the &ldquo;Old King.&rdquo; &ldquo;Why, it took
      my four boys a good day to tie up ten acres, Ben.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm talkin' 'bout binders,&rdquo; said Ben, in what could hardly be called a
      respectful tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Ben, no two men can bind ten acres in a day, so just quit yer
      blowin' an' talk sense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm talkin' 'bout binders,&rdquo; repeated Ben stubbornly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I tell you, Ben,&rdquo; replied the &ldquo;Old King,&rdquo; with emphasis, &ldquo;your boys&mdash;and
      they're good boys, too&mdash;can't tie no ten acres in a day. They've got
      the chance of tryin' on that ten acres of wheat on my west fifty. If they
      can do it in a day they can have it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They wouldn't take it,&rdquo; answered Ben regretfully. &ldquo;They can do it, fast
      enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then the &ldquo;Old King&rdquo; quite lost patience. &ldquo;Now, Ben, shut up! You're a
      blowhard! Why, I'd bet any man the whole field against $50 that it can't
      be done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll take you on that,&rdquo; said Alec Murray.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; The &ldquo;Old King&rdquo; was nonplussed for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll take that. But I guess you don't mean it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the &ldquo;Old King&rdquo; was too much of a sport to go back upon his offer.
      &ldquo;It's big odds,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But I'll stick to it. Though I want to tell
      you, there's nearer twelve acres than ten.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know the field,&rdquo; said Alec. &ldquo;But I'm willing to risk it. The winner
      pays the wages. How long a day?&rdquo; continued Alec.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quit at six.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The best part of the day is after that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make it eight, then,&rdquo; said the &ldquo;Old King.&rdquo; &ldquo;And we'll bring it off on
      Monday. We're thrashing that day, but the more the merrier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's jest one thing,&rdquo; interposed Ben, &ldquo;an' that is, the boys mustn't
      know about this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; said Alec. &ldquo;They're dead game.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Dick'd jump at it quick enough, but Barney wouldn't let 'im risk it.
      He's right careful of that boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After full discussion next Sabbath morning by those who were loitering,
      after their custom, in the churchyard waiting for the service to begin, it
      was generally agreed that the &ldquo;Old King&rdquo; with his usual shrewdness had
      &ldquo;put his money on the winning horse.&rdquo; Even Alec Murray, though he kept a
      bold face, confided to his bosom friend, Rory Ross, that he &ldquo;guessed his
      cake was dough, though they would make a pretty big stagger at it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Dick only had Barney's weight,&rdquo; said Rory, &ldquo;they would stand a better
      chance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. But Dick tires quicker. An' he'll die before he drops.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But ten acres, Alec! And there's more than ten acres in that field.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know. But it's standing nice, an' it's lighter on the knoll in the
      centre. If I can only get them goin' their best clip&mdash;I'll have to
      work it some way. I'll have to get Barney moving. Dick's such an ambitious
      little beggar he'd follow till he bust. The first thing,&rdquo; continued Alec,
      &ldquo;is to get them a good early start. I'll have a talk with Ben.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As a result of his conversation with Ben it was hardly daylight on Monday
      morning when Mrs. Boyle, glancing at her clock, sprang at once from her
      bed and called her sons.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're late, Barney. It's nearly six, and you have to go to Morrison's
      to-day. Here's Ben with the horses fed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, mother, it's only five o'clock by my watch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it's six.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Upon comparison Ben's watch corresponded with the clock. Barney concluded
      something must be wrong and routed Dick up, and with such good purpose did
      they hasten through breakfast that in an hour from the time the boys were
      called they were standing in the field waiting for Ben to begin the day's
      work.
    </p>
    <p>
      After they had been binding an hour Alec Murray appeared on the field.
      &ldquo;I'm going to shock,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;They've got men enough up at the
      thrashing, an' the 'Old King' wants to get this field in shock by
      to-morrow afternoon so he can get it thrashed, if you hustlers can get it
      down by then.&rdquo; Alec was apparently in great spirits. He brought with him
      into the field a breezy air of excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, Ben, don't take all day oiling up there. I guess I'm after you
      to-day, remember.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guess yeh'll wait till it's tied, won't yeh?&rdquo; said Ben, who thoroughly
      understood Alec's game.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't know 'bout that. I may have to jump in an' tie a few myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you fret yourself,&rdquo; replied Dick. &ldquo;If you shock all that's tied
      to-day you'll need to hang your shirt on the fence at night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep cool, Dick, or you'll be leavin' Barney too far behind. You tie
      quicker than him, I hear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don't know,&rdquo; said Dick modestly, though quite convinced in his own
      mind that he could.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dick's a little quicker, ain't he?&rdquo; said Alec, turning to Barney.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he's quick enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you never have a tussle?&rdquo; inquired Alec, snatching up a couple of
      sheaves in each arm and setting them in their places in the shock with a
      quick swing, then stepping off briskly for others.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Barney shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess he didn't want you to hurt yourself,&rdquo; he suggested cunningly to
      Dick. &ldquo;When a fellow isn't very strong he's got to be careful.&rdquo; This was
      Dick's sensitive point. He was not content to do a man's work in the
      field, but he was miserable unless he took first place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he needn't be afraid of hurting me,&rdquo; he said, taking Alec's bait.
      &ldquo;I've worked with him all harvest and I'm alive yet.&rdquo; Unconsciously Dick's
      pace quickened, and for the next few minutes Barney was left several
      sheaves behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's just foolin' with you, Dick,&rdquo; jeered Alec. &ldquo;He wouldn't hurt you for
      the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Unconsciously by his hustling manner and by his sly suggestion of
      superiority now to one and again to the other, he put both boys upon their
      mettle, and before they were aware they were going at a racing pace,
      though neither would acknowledge that to the other. Alec kept following
      them close, almost running for his sheaves, flinging a word of
      encouragement now to one, now to the other, shouting at Ben as he turned
      the corners, and by every means possible keeping the excitement at the
      highest point. But he was careful not to overdrive his men. By a previous
      arrangement and without serious difficulty he had persuaded Teenie Ross,
      who had come to assist the Morrison girls at the threshing, to bring out a
      lunch to the field at ten o'clock. For half an hour they sat in the long
      grass in the shade of a maple tree eating the lunch which Dick at least
      was beginning to feel in need of. But not a minute more did Alec allow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm going to catch you fellows,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if I've to take off my shirt
      to do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dick was quick to respond and again set off at full speed. But the grain
      was heavier than Alec had counted upon, and when the noon hour had arrived
      he estimated that the grain was not more than one-third down. A full hour
      and a half he allowed his men for rest, cunningly drawing them off from
      the crowd of threshers to a quiet place in the orchard where they could
      lie down and sleep, waking them when time was up that there should be no
      loss of a single precious moment. As they were going out to the field Alec
      suggested that instead of coming back for supper at five, according to the
      usual custom, they should have it brought to them in the field.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a long way up to the house,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;and the days are getting
      short.&rdquo; And though the boys didn't take very kindly to the suggestion,
      neither would think of opposing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in spite of all that Alec and Ben could do, when the threshers knocked
      off work for the day and sauntered down to the field where the reaping was
      going on, it looked as if the &ldquo;Old King&rdquo; were to win his bet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep out of this field!&rdquo; yelled Alec, as the men drew near; &ldquo;you're
      interferin' with our work. Come, get out!&rdquo; For the boys had begun to take
      it easy and chatting with some of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get away from here, I tell you!&rdquo; cried Alec. &ldquo;You line up along the fence
      and we'll show you how this thing should be done!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Realizing the fairness of his demand, the men retired from the field. The
      long shadows of the evening were falling across the field. The boys were
      both showing weariness at every step they took. Alec was at his wit's end.
      The grain was all cut, but there was still a large part of it to bind. He
      determined to take the boys into his confidence. He knew all the risk
      there was in this step. Barney might refuse to risk an injury to his
      brother. It was Alec's only chance, however, and walking over to the boys,
      he told them the issue at stake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boys,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I don't want you to hurt yourselves. I don't care a dern
      about the money. I'd like to beat 'Old King' Morrison and I'd like to see
      you make a record. You've done a big day's work already, and if you want
      to quit I won't say a word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quit!&rdquo; cried Dick in scorn, kindling at Alec's story. &ldquo;What time have we
      left?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have till eight o'clock. It's now just seven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on then, Barney!&rdquo; cried Dick. &ldquo;We're good for an hour, anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know, Dick,&rdquo; said Barney, hesitating.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come along! I can stand it and I know you can.&rdquo; And off he set again at
      racing pace and making no attempt to hide it.
    </p>
    <p>
      In half an hour there were still left them, taking two swaths apiece, the
      two long sides and the two short ends.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can't do it, boys,&rdquo; said Alec regretfully. &ldquo;Let 'er go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, boys,&rdquo; cried the &ldquo;Old King,&rdquo; who, with the crowd, had drawn near,
      &ldquo;you've done a big day's work. You'll hurt yourselves. You've earned
      double pay and you'll get it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; cried Dick. &ldquo;We'll put in the half hour at any rate. Come on,
      Barney! Never mind your rake!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His face looked pale and worn, but his eyes were ablaze with light, and
      but for his pale face there was no sign of weariness about him. He flung
      away his rake and, snatching up a band, kicked the sheaf together, caught
      it up, drew, tied, and fastened it as with one single act.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll show them waltz time, Barney,&rdquo; he called, springing toward the next
      sheaf. &ldquo;One&rdquo;&mdash;at the word he snatched up and made the band, &ldquo;two&rdquo;&mdash;he
      passed the band around the sheaf, kicking it at the same time into shape,
      &ldquo;three&rdquo;&mdash;he drew and knotted the band, shoving the end in with his
      thumb. After him went Barney. One&mdash;two&mdash;three! and a sheaf was
      done. One&mdash;two&mdash;three! and so from sheaf to sheaf. It took them
      fifteen minutes to go down the long side. Dick, who had the inside,
      finished and sprang to his place at the outer side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get inside!&rdquo; shouted Barney, &ldquo;let me take that swath!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come along!&rdquo; replied Dick, tying his sheaf.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fifteen minutes left, boys! I believe you're going to do it!&rdquo; At this Ben
      gave a yell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They're goin' to do it!&rdquo; he shouted, stumping around in great excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Double up, Dick!&rdquo; cried Barney, carrying one sheaf to the next and tying
      them both together. Dick followed Barney's example, but here his brother's
      extra strength told in the race. Close after them came the crowd, Alec
      leading them, watch in hand, all yelling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two minutes for that end, boys!&rdquo; cried Alec, as they reached the corner.
      &ldquo;You're goin' to do it, my hearties! You're goin' to do it!&rdquo; They had
      thirteen minutes in which to bind a side and an end.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They can't do it, Alec,&rdquo; said the &ldquo;Old King.&rdquo; &ldquo;They'll hurt themselves.
      Call them off!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you all right, Dick?&rdquo; cried Barney, swinging on to the outer swath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; panted his brother, striding in at his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on! We'll do it, then!&rdquo; replied Barney.
    </p>
    <p>
      Side by side they rushed. Sheaf by sheaf they tied together, Barney
      gradually gaining by the doubling process.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't wait for me,&rdquo; gasped Dick, &ldquo;if you can go faster!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One minute and a half, boys, if you can stand it!&rdquo; cried Alec, as they
      reached the last corner. &ldquo;One minute and a half, and we win!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There remained five sheaves on the outer of Barney's two swaths, two on
      the inner of Dick's. In all, nine for Barney, six for Dick. The sheaves
      were comparatively small. Springing at this swath, Barney doubled the
      first two, the second two, the third two, and putting the last three
      together swung in upon Dick's swath where there were two sheaves left.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you touch it!&rdquo; gasped Dick angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How's the time, Alec?&rdquo; panted Barney.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Half a minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before he spoke, Dick flung himself on his last two sheaves, crying, &ldquo;Out
      of the way there!&rdquo; snatched his band, passing it around the sheaf, tied
      it, flung it over his shoulder, and stood with his hands on his knees, his
      breath coming in sobbing gasps.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a few minutes the men went wild. Barney stepped to Dick's side, and
      patting him on the shoulder, said, &ldquo;Great man, Dick! But I was a fool to
      let you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's what you were!&rdquo; cried the &ldquo;Old King,&rdquo; slapping Dick on the back,
      &ldquo;but there's the greatest day's work ever done in these parts. The wheat's
      yours,&rdquo; he said, turning to Alec, &ldquo;but begad! I wish it was goin' to them
      that won it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' that's where it is going,&rdquo; said Alec, &ldquo;every blamed sheaf of it, to
      Ben's gang.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll take what's coming to us,&rdquo; said Barney shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told yeh so,&rdquo; said Ben regretfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, don't you know it was for you I took the bet?&rdquo; said Alec, angry that
      he should be balked in his good intention to help the boys.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll take our wages,&rdquo; repeated Barney in a tone that settled the
      controversy. &ldquo;The wheat is not ours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it ain't mine,&rdquo; said Alec, disgusted, remembering in how great peril
      his $50 had been.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, boys,&rdquo; said the &ldquo;Old King,&rdquo; &ldquo;it ain't mine. We'll divide it in
      three.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll take our wages,&rdquo; said Barney again, in sullen determination.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Confound the boy!&rdquo; cried the &ldquo;Old King.&rdquo; &ldquo;What'll we do with the wheat? I
      say, we'll give it to Ben; he's had hard luck this year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, by the jumpin' Jemima Jebbs!&rdquo; said Ben, stumping over to Barney's
      side. &ldquo;I stand with the boss. I take my wages.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, dog-gone you all! Will you take double pay, then? There's two days'
      good work there. And the rest we'll give to the church. Good thing the
      minister ain't here or he'd kick, too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; added the &ldquo;Old King,&rdquo; turning to his son Sam, &ldquo;after this you crawl
      into your shell when there's any blowin' bein' done about Ben's gang.&rdquo;

      LOVE'S TANGLED WAYS
    </h3>
    <p>
      The mill lane was prinked with all the June flowers. Over the snake fence
      massed the clover, red and white. Through the rails peeped the thistle
      bloom, pink and purple, and higher up above the top rail the white crest
      of the dogwood slowly nodded in the breeze this sweet summer day. In the
      clover the bumblebees, the crickets, and the grasshoppers boomed, chirped,
      crackled, shouting their joy to be alive in so good a place and on so good
      a day. Above, the sky was blue, pure blue, and all the bluer for the
      specks of cloud that hung, still-poised like white-winged birds, white
      against the blue. Last evening's rain had washed the world clean. The sky,
      the air, the flowers, the clover, red and white, the kindly grass that ran
      green everywhere under foot, the dusty road, all were washed clean. In the
      elm bunches by the fence, in the maples and thorns, the birds, their
      summer preoccupations forgotten at the bidding of this new washed day,
      recalled their spring songs and poured them forth with fine careless
      courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      In tune to this brave symphony of colour and song, and down this
      flower-prinked, song-filled, clean washed, grassy lane stepped Dick this
      summer morning, stepped with the spring and balance of the well-trained
      athlete, stepped with the step of a man whose heart makes him merry music.
      A clean-looking man was Dick, harmonious with the day and with the lane
      down which he stepped. Against the grey of his suit his hands, his face,
      and his neck, where the negligee shirt fell away wide, revealing his
      strong, full curves spreading to the shoulders, all showed ruddy brown. He
      was a man good to look upon, with his springy step, his tan skin, his
      clear eye, but chiefly because out of his clear eye a soul looked forth
      clean and unafraid upon God's good world of wholesome growing things.
    </p>
    <p>
      From his three years of 'varsity life he came back unspoiled to his
      boyhood's love of the open sky and of all things under it. He had just
      come through a great year in college, his third, the greatest in many ways
      of the college course. His class had thrust him into a man's place of
      leadership in that world where only manhood counts, and he had &ldquo;made
      good.&rdquo; In the literary, in the gym, on the campus he had made and held
      high place, and on the class lists, in spite of his many distractions, he
      had ranked a double first. Best of all, it filled him with warm gratitude
      to remember that none of his fellows had grudged him any of his good
      things. What a decent lot they were! It humbled him to think of their
      pride in him. He would not disappoint them. Noblesse oblige.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the crest of the hill he paused to look back, and here the pain that
      had been running below his consciousness, like the minor strain in rich
      music, came to the top. This was Barney's spot. At this spot Barney always
      made him pause to look back upon the old mill in its frame of beauty. Poor
      Barney! Twice he had gone down to the exams, and twice he had failed. Of
      all in the home circle only Dick could understand the full bitterness of
      the cup of humiliation that his brother had put silently to his lips and
      drained. To his mother, the failure brought no surprise, and she would
      have been glad enough to have him give up &ldquo;his notion of being a doctor
      and be content with the mill.&rdquo; She had no ambitions for poor Barney, who
      was &ldquo;a quiet lad and well-doing enough,&rdquo; an encomium which stood for all
      the virtues removed from any touch of genius. She was not hurt by his
      failure. Indeed, she could hardly understand how deep the shame had gone
      into his proud, reserved heart. His father did not talk about it, but
      carried him off to look at some of the mill machinery which had gone
      wrong, and it was only by a gentler tone in his voice that Barney knew
      that his father understood. But Dick, with his fuller knowledge of college
      life, realized as none other of them did the extent of Barney's miserable
      sense of defeat.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, as he looked back upon the mill, Barney's pain became his anew.
      The causes of his failure were not far to seek. &ldquo;He had no chance!&rdquo; said
      Dick aloud, leaning upon the top rail and looking with gloomy eyes upon
      the scene of beauty before him. Things had changed since old Doctor
      Ferguson's time. The scientific basis of medicine was coming to its place
      in medical study, and the old doctor's contempt for these new-fangled
      notions had wrought ill for Barney. Dick remembered how he had gone, hot
      with indignation for his brother, to the new English professor in
      chemistry, whose papers were the terror of all pass men and, indeed, all
      honour men who stuck too closely to the text-book. He remembered the
      Englishman's drawling contempt as, after looking up Barney's name and
      papers, he dismissed the matter with the words, &ldquo;He knows nothing whatever
      about the subject, couldn't conduct the simplest experiment, don't you
      know.&rdquo; Poor Barney! the ancient and elementary chemistry of Dr. Ferguson
      seemed to hold not even the remotest affinity to that which Professor Fish
      expected. Dick was glad this morning that he had had sense enough to hold
      his tongue in the professor's presence. It comforted him to recall the
      generous enthusiasm with which Dr. Trent, the most brilliant surgeon on
      the staff, had recalled Barney's name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your brother, is he? Well, sir, he's a wonder!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fish doesn't think so,&rdquo; Dick had replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Fish be hanged!&rdquo; the doctor had answered, with the fine contempt of a
      specialist in practical work for the theorist in medicine. &ldquo;He has some
      idiotic notions in his head that he plucks men for not knowing. I don't
      say they are not necessary, but useful chiefly for examination purposes.
      Send your brother down. Send him down. For if ever I saw an embryonic
      surgeon, he's one! When he comes, bring him to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He'll come,&rdquo; Dick had answered, his face hot to think that it was for his
      sake Barney had remained grinding at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he's going this fall,&rdquo; said Dick aloud, &ldquo;or no 'varsity for me.&rdquo; He
      pulled a letter out of his pocket. It was from his football comrade, young
      Macdonald, offering, in his father's name, to Barney and himself positions
      in one of the lumber mills far up the Ottawa, where, by working overtime,
      there was a chance of making $100 a month and all found. &ldquo;And we'll make
      it go,&rdquo; said Dick. &ldquo;There's $300 apiece for us, and that's more than we
      want. Poor old chap!&rdquo; he continued, musing aloud, &ldquo;he'll get his chance at
      last. Besides, we'll get him away from that girl, confound her! though I'm
      afraid it's no use now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A deeper pain surged up from the bottom of Dick's heart. &ldquo;That girl&rdquo; was
      Iola. The night before, as they were driving home in the growing dark,
      with halting words and with shamed face, as if he were doing his brother a
      wrong, Barney had confided to him that Iola and he had come to an
      understanding of their mutual love. Dick remembered this morning, and he
      would remember to his dying day, the sense of loss, of being forsaken,
      that had smitten him as he cried, &ldquo;Oh, Barney! is it possible?&rdquo; Then, as
      Barney had gone on to explain how it had come about, almost apologizing,
      as it seemed to Dick, for his weakness, Dick, seeing in the gloom a gleam
      of hope, had cried, &ldquo;We'll get you out of it, Barney. I'll help you this
      summer.&rdquo; And then again the inevitableness of what had taken place had
      come over him at Barney's reply: &ldquo;But, Dick, I don't want to get out of
      it.&rdquo; At that moment Dick's world changed. No longer was he first with his
      brother. Iola had taken his place. In vain Barney, guessing the thought in
      his heart, had protested with eager, almost piteous, appeal that Dick
      would be the same to him as ever. In the first acute moment of his pain he
      had cried out some quick word of bitter reproach, but the look on Barney's
      face had checked him. He was glad now that he had said nothing against the
      girl. And as he thought of her in the saner light of the morning, he felt
      that he could not be quite fair to her, and yet he wished it had been some
      other than Iola. &ldquo;It's that confounded voice of hers, and her eyes, and
      her whole get-up. She's got something diabolically fetching about her.&rdquo;
       Then, as if he had gone too far, he continued, still musing aloud, &ldquo;She's
      good enough, I guess, but not for Barney.&rdquo; That was one of the bitter
      things that had survived the night. She was not good enough for his
      brother, his hero, his beau ideal of high manhood ever since he could
      think. &ldquo;But there is no one good enough for Barney,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;except&mdash;yes&mdash;there
      is one&mdash;Margaret&mdash;she is good enough&mdash;even for Barney.&rdquo; As
      Barney among men, so Margaret among women had stood with Dick, peerless.
      And all his life he had put these two together. Even as a little fellow,
      when saying his prayers to his mother, next in the list to Barney's name
      had always come Margaret's. She was like Barney in so many ways; strong
      like Barney in her relentless devotion to duty; she had Barney's fine
      sense of honour, of righteousness, and Barney's superb courage, and, more
      than anything else, the same unfathomable heart of love. One could never
      get to the bottom of it. No matter what the drain, there would still be
      love there.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the thought of Margaret that had set his heart singing within him
      this morning. Even last night, after the first few moments of pain, the
      thought of Margaret had come to him, bringing an odd sense of happiness,
      and early this morning the first consciousness of loss, that had made him
      tighten his arm hard about his brother, had been followed by that feeling
      of happiness, indefinable at first, but soon traced to the thought of
      Margaret. For the first time in his life he thought of her unrelated to
      Barney. He had always loved Margaret, rejoiced in her high spirit, her
      courage, her downright sincerity, her deep heart, but never for himself,
      always for Barney. The first resentment that Barney should have passed her
      by for one like Iola had given way to a timid fluttering of heart that
      strengthened and deepened to a great joy that the way to Margaret for him
      stood open. For himself, now, he might love her. With such marvellous
      swiftness does love work that, when his mother bade him go &ldquo;pay his duty
      to the minister,&rdquo; his heart responded with so great a leap of joy that he
      found himself glancing quickly at the faces of those about him, sure that
      they must have noticed.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now he was on his way to Margaret. It was as if he had to make
      acquaintance of her. He wondered how she would greet him and he wondered
      what he should say to her. What would she be doing now? He glanced at his
      watch. It was just ten o'clock. The morning work would be done. She might
      come for a little stroll in the woods at the back of the manse, but he
      would say nothing to her to-day. He would wait and watch to read her
      heart. He sprang up the bank, that ran along beside the fence, to go on
      his way. A gleam of white through the snake fence against the pink of the
      clover caught his eye. Under the thorn tree&mdash;he knew the spot well&mdash;and
      upon the grass, lay a girl. &ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; he whispered, his heart stopping,
      thumping, then rushing, &ldquo;it is Margaret.&rdquo; He would creep up and surprise
      her. The deep grass deadened his footfalls. He was close to her. He held
      his breath. She lay asleep, one arm under her head, the other flung wide
      in an abandonment of weariness. He stood gazing down upon her. Pale she
      looked to him, and thin and weary. The lines about her mouth and eyes
      spoke of cares and of griefs, too. How much older she was than he had
      thought! &ldquo;Poor girl! she has been having a hard time! It's a shame, a
      downright shame! And she's only a child yet!&rdquo; At the thought of her long
      sacrifice for those three past years a great pity stole into his heart. At
      that touch of pity the love that had ever filled his heart, dammed back
      for so long by his regard for his brother's rights, suddenly finding its
      new channel, burst forth and swept like a torrent through his being. He
      lost grip of himself and, before he knew, he had bent over the sleeping
      girl and kissed her lips. A long shivering sigh shook her. &ldquo;Barney,&rdquo; she
      murmured, a slight smile playing about her lips. She opened her eyes. A
      moment she lay looking up into Dick's face, then, suddenly wide awake, she
      sat upright.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You! Dick!&rdquo; she cried, surprise, indignation, shame, mingling in her
      voice. &ldquo;You&mdash;you dare to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Margaret,&rdquo; said Dick, aghast at what he had done, &ldquo;I couldn't help
      it. You looked so sweet and so sad, and&mdash;and I love you so much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You,&rdquo; cried the girl again, as if she could find no other word. &ldquo;What did
      you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said, Margaret,&rdquo; he replied, gathering his courage together, &ldquo;that I
      love you so much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You love me?&rdquo; she gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I love you. I never knew till last night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Last night?&rdquo; she echoed, with her eyes upon his face, now grown pale, but
      illuminated with a light she had never seen there before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, last night. It was always there, Margaret,&rdquo; he hurried to say, &ldquo;but
      only last night I found out I might love you. I never let myself go. I
      thought I had no right. I mean I thought Barney&mdash;&rdquo; At the mention of
      his brother's name, the face that had been white with a look almost of
      horror flamed quickly with red. &ldquo;Last night,&rdquo; continued Dick, wondering at
      the change in her, &ldquo;I found out, and this morning, Margaret, the whole
      world is just humming with joy because I know I may love you all I want
      to. Oh, it's great! I never imagined a fellow could hold so much love or
      so much joy. Do you understand me, Margaret? Do you knew what I am talking
      about?&rdquo; Margaret's face had grown pale and haggard, as with pain, and her
      eyes were wide open with pity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Dick,&rdquo; she said slowly, &ldquo;I know. I have just been learning.&rdquo; The
      brave lips quivered, but she kept firm hold of herself. &ldquo;I know all the
      joy and&mdash;all the pain.&rdquo; She stopped short at the look in Dick's face.
      The buoyant, glad light flickered and went out. A look of perplexity, of
      great fear, and then of desolation, like that on her own face, spread over
      his. He knew her too well to misunderstand her meaning. She leaned over to
      him, still kneeling in the grass. &ldquo;Oh, Dick, dear!&rdquo; she cried, taking his
      hand in hers with a mother-touch and tone, &ldquo;must you suffer, too? Oh,
      don't say you must! Not with my pain, Dick! Not with my pain!&rdquo; Her voice
      rose in a cry, broke into a sob, but still she held him with her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you say I must?&rdquo; he answered in a hoarse tone. &ldquo;I love you with all my
      heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don't Dick, dear,&rdquo; she pleaded, &ldquo;don't say it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I will,&rdquo; he said, recovering his voice, &ldquo;because it's true. And I'm
      glad it's true. I'm glad that I can at last let myself love you. It was
      only last night when Barney told me about Iola, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; she said hurriedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had always thought that it was you, and I was glad to think so for
      Barney. But last night&rdquo;&mdash;here a quick flash of joy came into his face
      at the memory&mdash;&ldquo;I found out, and this morning I could hardly help
      shouting it as I came along to you.&rdquo; He paused, and, leaning toward her,
      he took her hand. &ldquo;Don't you think, Margaret, you might perhaps some
      time.&rdquo; The piteous entreaty in his voice broke down the girl's proud
      courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Dick! Oh, Dick!&rdquo; she sobbed, &ldquo;don't! Don't ask me!&rdquo; Her sobs came
      tempestuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      He put his arms about her and, stroking her yellow hair, gently said,
      &ldquo;Never mind, little girl. Don't do that! I can't stand that, and&mdash;well,
      I won't bother you a bit with my affair. Don't think about me. I'll get
      hold of myself. There now&mdash;hush, hush, girlie. Don't cry like that!&rdquo;
       He held her close to him, caressing her till she grew quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length she drew away, saying, &ldquo;I don't know why I should act like this.
      I haven't cried for a year. I think I am tired. It has been a hard winter,
      Dick. They used to play and sing together for hours. Oh, it was wonderful
      music, but I could have shrieked aloud. Don't think me horrid,&rdquo; she went
      on hurriedly. &ldquo;I wonder I am not ashamed to tell you. But I never let
      anyone know, neither of them nor anyone else. Mind you that, Dick, no one
      knows.&rdquo; She sat up straight, her courage coming back. &ldquo;I never meant to
      tell you, Dick, but you know you took me unaware.&rdquo; A little smile was
      struggling to the corners of her mouth and a faint flush touched her pale
      cheek. &ldquo;But I am glad you know. And, Dick, can't we go back? Won't you
      forget what you have said?&rdquo; Dick had been looking at her, wondering at her
      courage and self-command, but in his eyes a look of misery that went to
      the girl's heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forget!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Tell me how.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head, and then, reading his eyes, she cried aloud, &ldquo;Oh,
      Dick! must we go on and on like this?&rdquo; She pressed her hands hard upon her
      heart. &ldquo;There's a sore, sore pain right here,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Is there to be
      no rest, no relief from it? It's been there for two years.&rdquo; She was fast
      losing her grip of herself again. Once more he caught her in his strong
      brown hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Margaret dear, don't do that! We'll help each other somehow. God&mdash;yes,
      God will help us if He takes any interest in us at all. He can't let us go
      on like this!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The words steadied her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, Dick,&rdquo; she said, a sudden quiet falling upon her, &ldquo;there has been
      no one else for all these months, and He has helped me. He will help you,
      too. Come,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;let us go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sit down and talk,&rdquo; replied Dick. He looked at his watch. &ldquo;A quarter
      after ten,&rdquo; he said, in surprise. &ldquo;Can the whole world change in one
      little quarter of an hour?&rdquo; he asked, looking up at her, &ldquo;it was ten when
      I stopped at the hill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Dick,&rdquo; she said again, &ldquo;we'll talk another time, I can't trust
      myself just now. I was going to your mother's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Dick remained kneeling in the grass where he was. It seemed to him as
      if he had been in some strange land remote from this common life, and he
      shrank from contact with the ordinary day and its ordinary doings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't, Margaret,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You go. Let me fight it out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She knew too well where he was. &ldquo;No, Dick, I will not leave you here.
      Come, do.&rdquo; She went quickly to him, kneeled down, put her arms about his
      neck and kissed him. &ldquo;Help me, Dick,&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the word he needed. He threw his arms about her, kissed her once,
      and then, as if seized with a frenzy of passion, he kissed, again and
      again, her hair, her face, her hands, her lips, murmuring in hoarse,
      passionate tones, &ldquo;I love you! I love you!&rdquo; For a few moments she suffered
      him, and then gently pushed him back and drew apart from him. Her action
      recalled him to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me, Margaret,&rdquo; he cried brokenly, &ldquo;I'm a great, selfish brute. I
      think only of myself. Now I'm ready to go. And when I weaken again, don't
      think me quite a cad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sprang up, threw back his shoulders as if adjusting them to a load,
      gave her his hand, and lifted her up, and together they set off down the
      lane, the shadow a little lighter as each felt the other near.

    <h3>
      FOR A LADY'S HONOUR
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going to Trinity convocation tomorrow?&rdquo; asked Dr. Bulling of
      Iola.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were sitting in what Iola called her studio. A poor little room it
      was, but suggesting in every detail the artistic taste of its occupant.
      Its adornments, the luxurious arrangement of cushions in the cosey corner,
      the prints upon the walls, and the books on the little table, spoke of a
      pathetic attempt to reproduce the surroundings of luxurious art without
      the large outlay that art demands. At one side of the room stood a piano
      with music lying carelessly about. In another corner was Iola's guitar,
      which she seldom used now except when intimate friends gathered for one of
      the little suppers she loved to give. Then she took it up to sing the
      mammy songs of her childhood. On the side opposite to that on which the
      piano stood was a little fireplace. It was the fireplace that had
      determined the choice of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Dr. Bulling asked his question Iola's lace lit up with a sudden
      splendour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, of course,&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why 'of course'?&rdquo; inquired the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? Because a great friend of mine is to receive his degree and his gold
      medal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who is that, pray?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Boyle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you know him? Clever chap, they say. Can't say I know him. Have seen
      him a few times in the hospital with Trent. Struck me as rather crude.
      From the country, some place, isn't he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Iola, with ever so slight a hesitation, &ldquo;he is from the
      country, where I met him five&mdash;yes, it is actually five&mdash;years
      ago. So you see he is quite an old friend. And as for being crude, I think
      you can hardly call him that. Of course, he is not one of society's
      darlings, a patron of art, and a rising member of his profession as yet&rdquo;&mdash;this
      with a little bow to her visitor&mdash;&ldquo;but some day he will be great.
      And, besides, he is very nice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of that I have no doubt,&rdquo; said the doctor, &ldquo;seeing he is a friend of
      yours. But how are you going? Some friends of mine are to be there and
      will be glad to call for you.&rdquo; The doctor could hardly prevent a tone of
      condescension, almost of patronage, in his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very kind,&rdquo; said Iola, with just enough reserve in her manner to
      make the doctor conscious of his tone, &ldquo;but I am going with friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friends?&rdquo; inquired the doctor. &ldquo;And who, may I ask?&rdquo; There was an almost
      rude familiarity in his tone, but Iola only smiled at him the more
      sweetly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, very dear friends, and very old friends, and friends of Mr. Boyle. In
      fact, his brother, a theological student, and a Miss Robertson. I think
      you have met her. She is a nurse in the General Hospital.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nurse Robertson?&rdquo; said Bulling. &ldquo;Oh, yes, I know her. Pretty much of a
      saint, isn't she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A saint?&rdquo; cried Iola, for the first time throwing energy into her voice.
      &ldquo;Yes, a saint. But the best and sweetest and kindest and jolliest girl I
      know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should hardly have called her jolly,&rdquo; said the doctor, with an air of
      dismissing her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, she is!&rdquo; cried Iola, enthusiastically, her large eyes glowing eager
      enthusiasm. &ldquo;You ought to have seen her at home. Why, at sixteen years she
      took charge of her father's manse and the children in the most wonderful
      way. Looked after me, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor girl!&rdquo; murmured the doctor. &ldquo;She had a handful, sure enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you may say so. Then her father went on a trip to the old country,
      and, to the surprise of everybody, brought back a new wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And put the girl's nose out of joint,&rdquo; said the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, hardly that. But there was no longer need for her at home, and, on
      the whole, she felt better to be independent, and so here she has been for
      the last two years. She shares my room when she is at home, which is not
      often, and still takes care of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most fortunate young lady she is,&rdquo; murmured the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I am going with them,&rdquo; continued Iola.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I suppose nobody will see you.&rdquo; The doctor's tone was quite gloomy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I love to see all my friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be the usual thing,&rdquo; said the doctor, &ldquo;the same circle crowding
      you, the same impossibility of getting a word with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That depends on how much you&mdash;&rdquo; cried Iola, throwing a swift smile
      at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much I want to?&rdquo; interrupted the doctor eagerly. &ldquo;You know quite well
      I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much time there is. You see, one can't be rude. One must speak to all
      one's friends. But, of course, one can always plan one's time. How ever,&rdquo;
       she continued, &ldquo;one can hardly expect to see much of the very popular Dr.
      Bulling, whose attention is always so fully taken up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, rot!&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;I say, can't we get off a little together?
      There are nice quiet nooks about the old building.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, doctor, how shocking!&rdquo; But her eyes belied her voice, and the doctor
      departed with the lively expectation of a very pleasant convocation day at
      Trinity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The convocation passed off with the usual uproar on the part of the
      students and the usual long-suffering endurance on the part of the dean
      and faculty and those who were fortunate, or unfortunate, enough to be the
      orators of the day, the fervent enthusiasm of the undergraduate body
      finding expression, now in college songs, whose chief characteristic was
      the vigour with which they were rendered, personal remarks in the way of
      encouragement, deprecation, pity, or gentle reproof to all who had to take
      part in the public proceedings, and at intervals in wildly uproarious
      applause and cheers at the mention of the name of some favourite. At no
      point was the fervour greater than when Barney was called to receive his
      medal. To the little group of friends at the left of the desk, consisting
      of his brother, Margaret, and Iola, it seemed as if the cheering that
      greeted Barney's name was almost worthy of the occasion. Dr. Trent
      presented him, and as he spoke of the difficulties he had to contend with
      in the early part of his course, of the perseverance and indomitable
      courage the young man had shown, and the singular, indeed the very
      remarkable, ability he had manifested in the special line of study for
      which this medal was granted, the dead silence that pervaded the room was
      even more eloquent than the tumult of cheers that followed Dr. Trent's
      remarks and that continued until Barney had taken his place again among
      the graduating class.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then someone called out, &ldquo;What's the matter with old Carbuncle?&rdquo; eliciting
      the usual vociferous reply, &ldquo;He's all right!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove,&rdquo; said Dick to Margaret, who sat next him, &ldquo;isn't that great? And
      the old boy deserves it every bit!&rdquo; But Margaret made no reply. She was
      sitting with her eyes cast down, pale except for a spot of red in each
      cheek. At Dick's words she glanced at him for a moment, and he noticed
      that the large blue eyes were full of tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's all right, little girl,&rdquo; he whispered, giving her hand a little pat.
      He dared say no more, for the sight of her face and the look in her eyes
      set his own heart beating and gave him a choke in his throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other side of Margaret sat Iola, her face radiant with pride and
      joy, and as Barney reached his seat, turning half around and in the face
      of the whole company, she flashed him a look and a smile so full of pride
      and love that it seemed to him at that moment as if all he had endured for
      the last three years were quite worth while.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the formal proceedings were over, Dr. Bulling made his way to the
      little group about Barney.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Congratulations, Boyle,&rdquo; he said, in the somewhat patronizing manner of a
      graduate of some years' standing to one who holds his parchment in his
      hand and wears his still blushing honours as men wear new clothes, &ldquo;that
      was a remarkable fine reception you had to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barney's brief word of acknowledgment showed his resentment of Bulling's
      tone and his dislike of the man. It angered Barney to observe the
      familiar, almost confidential, manner of Dr. Bulling with Iola, but it
      made him more furious to notice that, instead of resenting, Iola seemed to
      be pleased with his manner. Just now, however, she was giving herself to
      Barney. Her pride in him, her joy in him, and her quiet appreciation of
      him, were evident to all, so evident, indeed, that after a few words Dr.
      Bulling took himself off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brute!&rdquo; said Barney as the doctor retired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I am sure he seems very nice,&rdquo; said Iola, raising her eyebrows in
      surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nice!&rdquo; said Barney contemptuously. &ldquo;If you knew how the men speak of him
      about town you wouldn't call him nice. He has money, and he's in the swim,
      but he's a beast, all the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Barney, you mustn't say so!&rdquo; cried Iola, &ldquo;for you know he's been a
      great friend to me. He has been very kind. I am quite devoted to him.&rdquo;
       Something in the tone of her voice, and more in the smile which she gave
      Barney, took the sting out of her words.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before many minutes had passed the little group was broken up, chiefly
      because of the fact that Iola was soon surrounded by a circle of her own
      admiring friends, and among them the most insistent was Dr. Bulling, who
      finally, with bluff, good-natured but almost rude aggressiveness, carried
      her off to the tearoom. It took all the joy out of the day for Barney, and
      on his behalf, for Margaret and Dick, that for the rest of the afternoon
      Iola's attention was entirely absorbed by Dr. Bulling and his little
      coterie of friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      And this feeling of disappointment in Iola and of resentment against Dr.
      Bulling he carried with him to a little stag dinner by the hospital staff
      at the Olympic that evening. The dinner was due chiefly to the exertions
      of Dr. Trent, and was intended by him not only to bring into closer touch
      with each other the members of the hospital staff, but also to be a kind
      of introduction of Barney to the inner circle of medical men in the city.
      For the past year Barney had acted as his clerk, almost as his assistant,
      and, indeed, Dr. Trent had made the formal proposition of an assistantship
      to him. Out of compliment to Barney, Dick had been invited, and young
      Drake also, who owed his parchment that day to Barney's merciless grinding
      in surgery, and perhaps more to his steadying friendship. Dr. Bulling,
      who, more for his great wealth and his large social connection than for
      his professional standing, had been invited, was present with Foxmore,
      Smead, and others who followed him about applauding his coarse jokes and
      accepting his favours. The dinner was purely informal in character, the
      menu well chosen, the wines abundant, and the drinking hard enough with
      some, with the result that as the dinner neared its end the men, and
      especially the group about Bulling, became more and more hilarious.
      Barney, who was drinking water and keeping his hand upon Drake's
      wineglass, found his attention divided between his conversation with Trent
      and the talk of Bulling, who, with his friends, sat across the table. As
      this group became more boisterous, they absorbed to themselves the
      attention of the whole company. Conscious of the prestige his wealth and
      social position accorded him, and inflamed by the wine he was drinking,
      Bulling became increasingly offensive. The talk degenerated. The stories
      and songs became more and more coarse in tone. It was Barney's first
      experience of a dinner of this kind, and it filled him with disgust and
      horror. Even Trent, by no means inexperienced in these matters, was
      disgusted with Bulling's tone. Following Barney's glances and aware of his
      wandering attention, he was about to propose a breakup of the party when
      he was arrested by a look of rigid and eager attention upon the face of
      his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Disgusting brute!&rdquo; said Trent, in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Barney heeded him not. His attention was concentrated upon Bulling. He
      had his glass in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here's to the Lane!&rdquo; he was saying, &ldquo;the sweetest little Lane in all the
      world!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's divine!&rdquo; replied Foxmore. &ldquo;And what a voice! She'll make Canada
      famous some day. Where did you discover her, Bulling?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In church,&rdquo; replied Bulling solemnly, to the uproarious delight of his
      followers. &ldquo;That's right,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;heard her sing, set things in
      motion, and now she's the leading voice in the cathedral. Introduced her
      to a few people, and there she is, the finest thing in her line in the
      city! Yes, and some day on the continent! A dear, sweet little lane it
      is,&rdquo; he continued in a tone of affectionate proprietorship that made
      Barney grind his teeth in furious rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That she is,&rdquo; said Smead enthusiastically, &ldquo;and thoroughly straight,
      too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Foxmore, &ldquo;there's no lane but has a turning. And trust
      Bulling,&rdquo; he added coarsely, &ldquo;for finding it out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Bulling, with a knowing smile, &ldquo;this little Lane is straight.
      Of course there may be a slight deflection. Nature's lines run in curves,
      you know.&rdquo; And again his wit provoked applauding laughter. But before the
      laughter had quite faded out a voice was heard, clear and cutting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dr. Bulling, you are a base liar!&rdquo; The words were plainly audible to
      every man in the room. A dead silence fell upon the company.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; said the doctor, sitting up straight, as if he had not heard
      aright.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say you are a cowardly liar!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the deuce do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have just made an insinuation against the honour of a young lady. I
      say again you are a mean and cowardly liar. I want you to say so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment or two Bulling's surprise kept him silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite right,&rdquo; said Trent. &ldquo;Beastly cad!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Dr. Bulling broke forth. &ldquo;You impertinent young cub! What do you
      mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For answer, Barney seized Drake's wineglass, half full of wine, and flung
      glass and contents full in Bulling's face. In an instant every man was on
      his feet. Above the din rose Foxmore's voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give it to him Bulling! Give it to the young prig!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No hurry about this, boys,&rdquo; said Bulling quietly; &ldquo;I'll make him eat his
      words before he's half an hour older.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meantime Dick was entreating his brother. &ldquo;Let me at him. He's a great
      knocker. Held the 'varsity championship. You don't know anything about it.
      Let me at him, Barney. I can do him up.&rdquo; Dick had been 'varsity champion
      in his own time. But Barney put Dick aside with quiet, stern words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't interfere, Dick. No matter what happens, don't interfere to-night.
      I won't have it, Dick, remember. It may take us an hour or it may take all
      night, but he'll say he lied before I'm through with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meantime the men, and chief among them Trent, were seeking to appease the
      doctor and to patch up the peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he apologizes I shall let the young cub off,&rdquo; were the doctor's terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he says he lied,&rdquo; was Barney's condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't disturb yourselves, gentlemen,&rdquo; said Bulling; &ldquo;it will not take
      more than two minutes, and then we can finish our smoke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The moment they stood facing each other Barney rushed, only to receive a
      heavy blow which hurled him backward. It was plain he knew nothing of the
      game. It was equally plain that the doctor was entirely master of it.
      Again and again Barney rushed in wildly, the doctor easily blocking,
      avoiding and sending in killing blows, till at length bloody, dazed,
      panting, Barney had to lean against his friends to recover his wind and
      strength. Opposite him, cool, smiling, and untouched, stood his adversary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is easy, boys,&rdquo; he smiled. &ldquo;Now, you young whipper-snapper,&rdquo; he
      continued, addressing Barney, &ldquo;perhaps you've had enough. Let me tell you,
      it's time for you to quit fooling, or, by the Eternal, I'll send you to
      sleep!&rdquo; As he spoke he closed his teeth with a savage snap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you say you're a liar?&rdquo; said Barney, facing his opponent again, and
      disregarding Dick's entreaties and warnings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, quit it!&rdquo; said the doctor contemptuously, &ldquo;Come along, you fool, if
      you must have it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Once more Barney rushed. As he did so Bulling stopped him with a heavy
      left-hander on the face which sent him reeling backward, quickly following
      with his right and again with a last terrific blow upon the jaw of his
      dazed and reeling victim. Barney fell with a crash upon the floor, and lay
      quiet. With a cry Dick sprang at Bulling, but half a dozen men pulled him
      off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him come,&rdquo; said Bulling, with a laugh, &ldquo;I've a very fine assortment
      of the same kind. Families supplied on reasonable terms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meantime, while the men were struggling with Dick, Dr. Trent and Drake
      were trying to revive poor Barney, bathing his face and hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stand back! Don't crowd about, men! Bring me a little brandy, someone,&rdquo;
       said Dr. Trent. &ldquo;A more cowardly brute I've never seen. You're a disgrace
      to the profession, Bulling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, thanks. I don't need your credentials, Trent,&rdquo; said Bulling
      cynically.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Trent, ignoring him, devoted himself to Barney, who showed signs of
      reviving. It was some minutes, however, before he could sit up. Meanwhile
      Bulling with his friends retired to the lavatory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, Boyle,&rdquo; said Treat, holding a glass to his lips as Barney sat up,
      &ldquo;a little more brandy and water.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a few moments after he drank the liquor Barney sat gazing stupidly
      about. Then, as full consciousness returned, cried out, &ldquo;Where is he? He's
      not gone?&rdquo; He seized the glass of brandy and water from Dr. Treat's hands
      and drank it off. &ldquo;Get me another,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Is he gone?&rdquo; he repeated,
      making an effort to rise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind, Boyle, he's gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait till another day, Barney,&rdquo; entreated Dick. &ldquo;Never mind to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment the sound of Dr. Bulling's voice, followed by loud
      laughter, came from the lavatory. At once Barney stood up, walked to the
      table, poured out a glass of brandy and drank it raw. For a minute he
      stood stretching his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, that's better,&rdquo; he said, and started toward the lavatory, but Dick
      clung to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Barney, listen to me,&rdquo; he entreated, his voice coming in broken sobs.
      &ldquo;He'll kill you. Let me take your place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dick, keep out of it,&rdquo; said Barney. &ldquo;Don't worry. He'll hurt me no more,
      but he'll say it before I'm done.&rdquo; And, throwing off the restraining
      hands, he made his way into the lavatory. Dr. Bulling was arranging his
      collar before a glass. As Barney entered he turned around.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sorry, Boyle,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;but you brought it on yourself, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barney walked straight up to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't hear you say you are a liar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; cried Bulling, &ldquo;haven't you got enough. Be thankful you're
      not killed. Go on! Get home! I don't run a butcher shop!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you say you're a liar and a cowardly liar?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barney's voice had in it the ring of cold steel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, boys,&rdquo; said Bulling, appealing to the crowd, &ldquo;keep this fool off.
      I don't want to kill him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foxmore, with some of the others, approached Barney.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Boyle, quit it,&rdquo; said Foxmore. &ldquo;There's no use, you see.&rdquo; He laid
      his hand on Barney's arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barney put his hand against his breast, appearing to brush him aside, but
      Foxmore touched nothing till he struck the wall ten feet away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get back!&rdquo; cried Barney, springing away from the men approaching him. As
      he spoke, he seized a small oak dressing table by one of its legs, swung
      it round his head, dashed it to pieces on the marble floor, and, putting
      his foot upon the wreckage, with one mighty wrench had the leg free in his
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You men stand back,&rdquo; he said in a low voice, &ldquo;and don't any of you
      interfere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amazed at this exhibition of furious strength, the men started back to
      their places, leaving a wide space about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo; said Bulling, his face turning a shade pale, &ldquo;the man is
      mad! Call a policeman, some of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drake, lock that door and bring me the key,&rdquo; said Barney.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Barney put the key in his pocket and turned again toward Bulling, the
      latter's pallor increased. &ldquo;I take you men to witness,&rdquo; he said, appealing
      to the company, &ldquo;if murder is done I'm not responsible. I'm defending my
      life. Remember, I'll strike to kill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Dr. Bulling,&rdquo; said Barney, handing his club to Drake, &ldquo;you won't
      strike at all. I've had my lesson. You'll strike me no more. The boxing
      exhibition is over. This is a fight till you can fight no more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor's nerve was fast going. Barney stood cool, quiet, and terrible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll give you your chance once again,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Will you say you are a
      cowardly liar?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Bulling glanced at the group back of him, read pain in their faces,
      hesitated a moment, then, pulling himself together, said, with an evident
      effort at bluster, &ldquo;Not by a &mdash;&mdash; sight! Come on! Take your
      medicine!&rdquo; But the lesson of the last half hour had not been lost on
      Barney. Up and down the long room, circling about his man, feinting to
      draw his attack, eluding, and again feinting, Barney kept his antagonist
      in such rapid motion and so intensely on the alert that his wind began to
      fail him, and it soon became evident that he could not stand the pace for
      very long.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've got him!&rdquo; cried Dick, in an ecstasy of expectation. &ldquo;Keep it up,
      Barney! That's the game! You'll have him in five minutes more!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite evident,&rdquo; echoed Dr. Trent quietly, hugely enjoying the change in
      the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Bulling heard the words. His pallor deepened. Red blotches began to
      appear on his cheek. The sweat stood out upon his forehead. His breath
      came in short gasps. He knew he could not last much longer. His only hope
      lay in immediate attack. He must finish off his man within the next minute
      or accept defeat. Nature was now taking revenge upon him for his long
      outraging of her laws. Barney, on the other hand, though bruised and
      battered about the face, was stepping about easily and lightly, without
      any sign of the terrible punishment he had suffered. Reading his
      opponent's face he knew that the moment for a supreme effort had arrived,
      and waited for his plan to develop. There was only one thing for Bulling
      to do. Edging his opponent toward the corner and summoning his fast
      failing strength for a final attack, he forced him hard back into the
      angle of the wall. He had him now. One clean blow and all would be over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look out, Barney!&rdquo; yelled Dick.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, as if shot from a steel spring, Barney crouched low and leaped
      at his man, and disregarding two heavy blows, thrust one long arm forward
      and with his sinewy fingers gripped his enemy's throat. &ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; he cried
      with savage exultation, holding off his foe at arm's length. &ldquo;Now! Now!
      Now!&rdquo; As he uttered each word between his clenched teeth he shook the
      gasping, choking wretch as a dog shakes a rat. In vain his victim
      struggled to get free, now striking wild and futile blows, now clutching
      and clawing at those terrible gripping fingers. His face grew purple; his
      tongue protruded; his breath came in rasping gasps; his hands fell to his
      side. &ldquo;Keep your hands so,&rdquo; hissed Barney, loosening his grip to give him
      air. &ldquo;Ha! would you? Don't you move!&rdquo; gripping him hard again. &ldquo;There!&rdquo;
       loosening once more, &ldquo;now, are you a liar? Speak quick!&rdquo; The blue lips
      made an attempt at the affirmation of which the head made the sign. &ldquo;Say
      it again. Are you a liar?&rdquo; Once more the head nodded and the lips
      attempted to speak. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Barney, still through his clenched teeth,
      &ldquo;you are a cowardly liar!&rdquo; The words came forth with terrible
      deliberation. &ldquo;I could kill you with my hands as you stand. But I won't,
      you cur! I'll just do this.&rdquo; As he spoke he once more tightened his grip
      upon the throat and swung his open hand on the livid cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For God's sake, Boyle,&rdquo; cried Foxmore, &ldquo;let up! That's enough!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it's enough,&rdquo; said Barney, flinging the semi-conscious man on the
      floor, &ldquo;it's enough for him. Foxmore, you laughed, I think, when he
      uttered that lie,&rdquo; he said in a voice smooth, almost sweet, but that
      chilled the hearts of the hearers, &ldquo;you laughed. You were a beastly cad,
      weren't you? Speak!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? I&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo; gasped Foxmore, backing into the corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quick, quick!&rdquo; cried Barney, stepping lightly toward him on his toes,
      &ldquo;say it quick!&rdquo; His fingers were working convulsively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, I was!&rdquo; cried Foxmore, backing further away behind the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; cried Barney, his voice rising hoarse, &ldquo;you would all of you laugh
      at that brute ruin the name and honour of a lonely girl!&rdquo; He walked up and
      down before the group which stood huddled in the corner in abject terror,
      more like a wild beast than a man. &ldquo;You're not fit to live! You're beasts
      of prey! No decent girl is safe from you!&rdquo; His voice rose loud and thin
      and harsh. He was fast losing hold of himself. His ghastly face, bloody
      and horribly disfigured, made an appalling setting for his blazing eyes.
      Nearer and nearer the crowd he walked, gnashing and grinding his teeth
      till the foam fell from his lips. The wild fury of his Highland ancestors
      was turning him into a wild beast with a wild beast's lust of blood.
      Further and further back cowered the group without a word, so utterly
      panic-stricken were they.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Barney,&rdquo; said Dick quietly, &ldquo;come home.&rdquo; He stopped short, with a mighty
      effort recalling his reason. For a few moments he stood silent looking at
      the floor, then, raising his eyes, he let them rest upon the doctor, who
      was leaning against the wall, and, without a word, turned and slowly
      passed out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gad!&rdquo; said Foxmore, with a horrible gasp of relief, &ldquo;if the devil looks
      like that I never want to see him.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      XI
    </h2>
    <h3>
      IOLA'S CHOICE
    </h3>
    <p>
      Iola was undoubtedly pleased; her lips parting in a half smile, her eyes
      shining through half-closed lids, her whole face glowing with a warm light
      proclaimed the joy in her heart. The morning letters lay on her table. She
      sat some moments holding one which she had opened, while she gazed
      dreamily out through the branches of the big elms that overshadowed her
      window. She would not move lest the dream should break and vanish. As she
      lay back in her chair looking out upon the moving leaves and waving
      boughs, she allowed the past to come back to her. How far away seemed the
      golden days of her Southern childhood. Almost her first recollection of
      sorrow, certainly the first that made any deep impression upon her heart,
      was when the men carried out her father in a black box and when, leaving
      the big house with the wide pillared veranda, she was taken to the chilly
      North. How terribly vivid was the memory of her miserable girlhood,
      poverty pressed and loveless, her soul beating like a caged bird against
      the bars of the cold and rigid discipline of her aunt's well-ordered home.
      Then came the first glad freedom from dependence when first she undertook
      to earn her own bread as a teacher. Freedom and love came to her together,
      freedom and love and friendship in the Manse and the Old Stone Mill. With
      the memory of the Mill, there rose before her, clear-limned and vividly
      real, one face, rugged, strong, and passionate, and the thought of him
      brought a warmer light to her eyes and a stronger beat to her heart. Every
      feature of the moonlight scene on the night of the barn-raising when first
      she saw him stood out with startling distinctness, the new skeleton of the
      barn gleaming bony and bare against the sky, the dusky forms crowding
      about, and, sitting upon a barrel across the open moonlit space of the
      barn floor, the dark-faced lad playing his violin and listening while she
      sang. At that point it was that life for her began.
    </p>
    <p>
      A new scene passed before her eyes. It was the Manse parlour, the music
      professor with dirty, claw-like fingers but face alight with rapturous
      delight playing for her while she sang her first great oratorio aria. She
      could feel to-day that mysterious thrill in the dawning sense of new
      powers as the old man, with his hands upon her shoulders, cried in his
      trembling, broken voice, &ldquo;My dear young lady, the world will listen to you
      some day!&rdquo; That was the beginning of her great ambition. That day she
      began to look for the time when the world would come to listen. Then
      followed weary days and weeks and months and years, weary with
      self-denials new to her and with painful struggling with unmusical pupils,
      for she needed bread; weary with heart-breaking strivings and failings in
      the practice of her art, but, worst of all, weary to heart-break with the
      patronage of the rich and flattering friends&mdash;how she loathed it&mdash;of
      whom Dr. Bulling was the most insistent and the most objectionable. And
      then this last campaign, with its plans and schemes for a place in the
      great Philharmonic which would at once insure not only her standing in the
      city, but a New York engagement as well. And now the moment of triumph had
      arrived. The letter she held in her hand was proof of it. She glanced once
      more at the written page, her eye falling upon a phrase here and there,
      &ldquo;We have succeeded at last&mdash;the Duff Charringtons have surrendered&mdash;you
      only want a chance&mdash;here it is&mdash;you can do the part well.&rdquo; She
      smiled a little. Yes, she knew she could do the part. &ldquo;And now let nothing
      or nobody prevent you from accepting Mrs. Duff Charrington's invitation
      for next Saturday. It is a beautiful yacht and well found, and I am
      confident the great lady will be gracious&mdash;bring your guitar with
      you, and if you will only be kind, I foresee two golden days in store for
      me.&rdquo; She allowed a smile slightly sarcastic to curl her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The doctor is inclined to be poetical. Well, we shall see. Saturday? That
      means Sunday spent on board the yacht. I wish they had it made another
      day. Margaret won't like it, and Barney won't either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment or two she allowed her mind to go back to the Sundays spent
      in the Manse. She had never known the meaning of the day before. The utter
      difference in feeling, in atmosphere, between that day and the other days
      of the week, the subduing quiet, the soothing peace, and the sense of
      sacredness that pervaded life on that day, made the Sabbaths in the Manse
      like blessed isles of rest in the sea of time. Never, since her two years
      spent there, had she been able to get quite away from the sense of
      obligation to make the day differ from the ordinary days of the week. No,
      she was sure Barney would not like it. Still, she could spend its hours
      quietly enough upon the yacht.
    </p>
    <p>
      She picked up another letter in a large square envelope, the address
      written in bold characters. &ldquo;This is the Duff Charrington invitation, I
      suppose,&rdquo; she said, opening the letter. &ldquo;Well, she does it nicely, at any
      rate, even if, as Dr. Bulling suggests, somewhat against her inclination.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again she sat back in silent dreaming, her eyes looking far away down the
      coming years of triumph. Surely enough, the big world was drawing near to
      listen. All she had read of the great queens of song, Patti, Nilsson,
      Rosa, Trebelli, Sterling, crowded in upon her mind, their regal courts
      thronged by the great and rich of every land, their country seats, their
      luxurious lives. At last her foot was in the path. It only remained for
      her to press forward. Work? She well knew how hard must be her daily lot.
      Yes, but that lesson she had learned, and thoroughly well, during these
      past years, how to work long hours, to deny herself the things her
      luxurious soul longed for, and, hardest of all, to bear with and smile at
      those she detested. All these she would endure a little longer. The days
      were coming when she would have her desire and do her will.
    </p>
    <p>
      She glanced at the other letters upon the table. &ldquo;Barney,&rdquo; she cried,
      seizing one. An odd compunction struck into her heart. &ldquo;Barney, poor old
      boy!&rdquo; A sudden thought stayed her hand from opening the letter. Where had
      Barney been in this picture of the future years upon which she had been
      feasting her soul? Aghast, she realized that, amid its splendid triumphs,
      Barney had not appeared. &ldquo;Of course, he'll be there,&rdquo; she murmured
      somewhat impatiently. But how and in what capacity she could not quite
      see. Some prima donnas had husbands, mere shadowy appendages to their
      courts. Others there were who found their husbands most useful as
      financial agents, business managers, or upper servants. Iola smiled a
      proud little smile. Barney would not do for any of these discreetly
      shadowy, conveniently colourless or more useful husbands. Would he be her
      husband? A warm glow came into her eyes and a flush upon her cheek. Her
      husband? Yes, surely, but not for a time. For some years she must be free
      to study, and&mdash;well, it was better to be free till she had made her
      name and her place in the world. Then when she had settled down Barney
      would come to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      But how would Barney accept her programme? Sure as she was of his great
      love, and with all her love for him, she was a little afraid of him. He
      was so strong, so silently immovable. Often in the past three years she
      had made trial of that immovable strength, seeking to draw him away from
      his work to some social engagement, to her so important, to him so
      incidental. She had always failed. His work absorbed him as her art had
      her, but with a difference. With Barney, work was his reward; with her, a
      means to it. To gain some further knowledge, to teach his fingers some
      finer skill, that was enough for Barney. Iola wrought at her long tasks
      and practised her unusual self-denials with her eye upon the public. Her
      reward would come when she had brought the world, listening, to her feet.
      Seized in the thrall of his work, Barney grimly held to it, come what
      might. No such absorbing passion possessed Iola. And Iola, while she was
      provoked by what she called his stubbornness, was yet secretly proud of
      that silently resisting strength she could neither shake nor break. No,
      Barney was not fitted for the role of the shadowy, pliant, convenient
      husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      What, then, in her plan of life would be his place? It startled her to
      discover that her plan had been complete without him. Complete? Ah, no.
      Her life without Barney would be like a house without its back wall.
      During these years of study and toil, while Barney could only give her
      snatches of his time, she had come to feel with increasing strength that
      her life was built round about him. When others had been applauding her
      successes, she waited for Barney's word; and though beside the clever,
      brilliant men that moved in the circle into which her art had brought her
      he might appear awkward and dull, yet it was Barney who continued to be
      the standard by which she judged men. With all his need of polish, his
      poverty of small talk, his hopeless ignorance of the conventions, and his
      obvious disregard of them, the massive strength of him, his fine sense of
      honour, his chivalrous bearing toward women, added a touch of reverence to
      the love she bore him. But more than all, it was to Barney her heart
      turned for its rest. She knew well that she held in all its depth and
      strength his heart's love. He would never fail her. She could not exhaust
      that deep well. But the question returned, where would Barney be while she
      was being conducted by acclaiming multitudes along her triumphal way? &ldquo;Oh,
      he will wait&mdash;we will wait,&rdquo; she corrected, shrinking from the
      heartlessness of the former phrasing. How many years she could not say.
      But deep in her heart was the determination that nothing should stand in
      the way of the ambition she had so long cherished and for which she had so
      greatly endured.
    </p>
    <p>
      She opened the note with lingering deliberation as one dallies with an
      approaching delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;MY DEAR IOLA: I have always told you the truth. I could not see you last
      evening, nor can I to-day, and perhaps not for a day or two, because my
      face is disfigured. These are the facts: At the dinner, night before last,
      Dr. Bulling lied about you. I made him swallow his lie and in the process
      got rather badly marked, though not at all hurt. The doctor and his
      friends will, I think, guard their tongues in future, at least in my
      hearing. Dr. Bulling is a man of vile mind and of unclean life. He should
      not be allowed to appear with decent people. I have written to forbid him
      ever approaching you in public. You will know how to treat him if he
      attempts it. This will be a most disgusting business to you. I hate to
      make you suffer, but it had to be done, and by no one but me. Would I
      could bear it all for you, my darling. The patronage of these people, I
      mean Dr. Bulling's set, cannot, surely, be necessary to your success. Your
      great voice needs not their patronage; if so, failure would be better.
      When I am fit for your presence I shall come to you. Good-bye. It is hard
      not to see you. Ever yours,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Barney.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alas! for her dreams. How rudely they were dispelled! Alas! for her castle
      in Spain. Already it was tottering to ruin, and by Barney's hand. She read
      the note hurriedly again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He wants me to break with Dr. Bulling.&rdquo; She recalled a sentence in the
      doctor's letter. &ldquo;Let no one or nothing keep you from accepting this
      invitation.&rdquo; &ldquo;He's afraid Barney will keep me back. Nonsense! How stupid
      of Barney! He is so terribly particular! He doesn't understand these
      things. There has been a horrid row of some kind and now he asks me to cut
      Dr. Bulling!&rdquo; She glanced at Barney's letter. &ldquo;Well, he doesn't ask me,
      but it's all the same&mdash;'you will know how to treat him.' He's too
      proud to ask me, but he expects me to. It would be sheer madness! Wouldn't
      the Duff Charrington's and Evelyn Redd be delighted! It is preposterous! I
      must go! I shall go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rarely did Iola allow herself the luxury of a downright burst of passion.
      With her, it was hardly ever worth while to be seriously angry. It was so
      much easier to avoid straight issues. But to-day there was no avoiding.
      She surprised herself with a storm of indignant rage so heart-shaking that
      after it had passed she was thankful she had been alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter with me?&rdquo; she asked herself. She did not know that the
      whole volume of her ambition, which had absorbed so great a part of her
      life, had come, in all its might, against the massive rock of Barney's
      will. He would never yield, she knew well. &ldquo;What shall I do?&rdquo; she cried
      aloud, beginning to pace the room. &ldquo;Margaret will tell me. No, she would
      be sure to side with Barney. She would think it was wicked to go on
      Sunday, anyway, and, besides, she has Barney's rigid notions about things.
      I wish I could see Dick. Dick will understand. He has seen more of this
      life and&mdash;oh, he's not so terribly hidebound. And I'll get Dick to
      see Barney.&rdquo; She would not acknowledge that she was grateful that Barney
      could not come to see her, but she could write him a note and she could
      send Dick to him, and in the meantime she would accept the invitation. &ldquo;I
      will accept at once. I wish I had before I read Barney's note. I really
      had accepted in my mind, and, besides, the arrangements were all made.
      I'll write the letters now.&rdquo; She hastened to burn her bridges behind her
      so that retreat might be impossible. &ldquo;There,&rdquo; she cried, as she sealed,
      addressed, and stamped the letters, &ldquo;I wish they were in the box. I'm
      awfully afraid I'll change. But I can't change! I cannot let this chance
      go! I have worked too long and too hard! Barney should not ask it!&rdquo; A wave
      of self-pity swept over her, bringing her temporary comfort. Surely Barney
      would not cause her pain, would not force her to give up her great
      opportunity. She sought to prolong this mood. She pictured herself a
      forlorn maiden in distress whom it was Barney's duty and privilege to
      rescue. &ldquo;I'll just go and post these now,&rdquo; she said. Hastily she put on
      her hat and ran down with the letters, fearing lest the passing of her
      self-pity might leave her to face again the thought of Barney's inevitable
      and immovable opposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, that's done,&rdquo; she said to herself, as the lid of the post box
      clicked upon her letters. &ldquo;Oh, I wonder&mdash;I wish I hadn't!&rdquo; What she
      had feared had come to pass. She had committed herself, and now her
      self-pity had evaporated and left her face to face with the inevitable
      results. With terrible clearness she saw Barney's dark, rugged face with
      the deep-seeing eyes. &ldquo;He always makes you feel in the wrong,&rdquo; she said
      impatiently. &ldquo;You can never think what to say. He always seems right,
      and,&rdquo; she added honestly, &ldquo;he is right generally. Never mind, Dick will
      help me.&rdquo; She shook off her load and ran on. At her door she met Dr.
      Foxmore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, good-morning,&rdquo; smiled the doctor, showing a double row of white teeth
      under his waxed mustache. &ldquo;And how does the fair Miss Lane find herself
      this fine morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It took the whole force of Iola's self-mastery to keep the disgust which
      was swelling her heart from showing in her face. Here was one of Dr.
      Bulling's friends, one of his toadies&mdash;and he had a number of them&mdash;who
      represented to her all that was most loathsome in her life. The effort to
      repress her disgust, however, only made her smile the sweeter. Foxmore was
      greatly encouraged. It was one of his fixed ideas that his manner was
      irresistible with &ldquo;the sex.&rdquo; Bulling might hold over him, by reason of his
      wealth and social position, but give him a fair field without handicap and
      see who would win out!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was about to do myself the honour and the pleasure of calling upon you
      this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, indeed. Well&mdash;ah&mdash;come in.&rdquo; Iola was fighting fiercely her
      loathing of him. It was against this man and his friends that Barney had
      defended her name. She led the way to her studio, ignoring the silly
      chatter of the man following her upstairs, and by the time he had fairly
      got himself seated she was coolly master of herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just ran in to give you the great news.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To wit?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, don't you know? The Philharmonic thing is settled. You've got it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Iola looked blank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, haven't you heard that the Duff Charringtons have surrendered?&rdquo; Iola
      recognized Dr. Bulling's words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surrendered? Just what, exactly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, d-dash it all! You know the big fight that has been going on, the
      Duff Charringtons backing that little Redd girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! So the Duff Charringtons have been backing the little Redd girl? Miss
      Evelyn Redd, I suppose? It sounds a little like a horse race or a
      pugilistic encounter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A horse race!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Ha, ha, ha! A horse race isn't in it with
      this! But Bulling pulled the wires and you've got it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this is extremely interesting. I was not aware that the soloists were
      chosen for any other reason than that of merit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In spite of herself Iola had adopted a cool and somewhat lofty manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well, certainly on merit, of course. But you know how these things
      go.&rdquo; Dr. Foxmore was beginning to feel uncomfortable. The lofty air of
      this struggling, as yet unrecognized, country girl was both baffling and
      exasperating. &ldquo;Oh, come, Miss Lane,&rdquo; he continued, making a desperate
      effort to recover his patronizing tone, &ldquo;you know just what we all think
      of your ability.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think of it?&rdquo; Iola's tone was calmly curious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I think&mdash;well&mdash;I know you can do the work infinitely
      better than Evelyn Redd.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you heard Miss Redd in oratorio? I know you have never heard me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, can't say I have; but I know your voice and your style and I'm
      confident it will suit the part.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you so much,&rdquo; said Iola sweetly; &ldquo;I am so sorry that Dr. Bulling
      should have given so much time, and he is such a busy man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that's nothing,&rdquo; waved Dr. Foxmore, recovering his self-esteem, &ldquo;we
      enjoyed it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How nice of you! And you were pulling wires, too, Dr. Foxmore?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, well, we did a little work in a quiet way,&rdquo; replied the doctor,
      falling into his best professional tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this yachting party, I suppose Dr. Bulling and you worked that, too?
      Really, Dr. Foxmore, you have no idea what a relief it is to have one's
      affairs taken charge of in this way. It quite saves one the trouble of
      making up one's mind. Indeed, one hardly needs a mind at all.&rdquo; Iola's face
      and smile were those of innocent childhood. Dr. Foxmore shot a suspicious
      glance at her and hastened to change the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you will go next Saturday, will you not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am really a little uncertain at present,&rdquo; replied Iola.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you must, you know! Mrs. Duff Charrington will be awfully cut up, not
      to speak of Bulling. He had no end of trouble to bring it off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean, to persuade Mrs. Duff Charrington to invite me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; said the doctor, plunging wildly, &ldquo;I wouldn't put it that way.
      But the whole question of the Philharmonic was involved, and this
      invitation was a flag of truce, as it were.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your metaphors certainly have a warlike flavour, Dr. Foxmore; I cannot
      pretend to follow the workings of your mind. But seeing that this
      invitation has been secured at the expense of such effort on the part of
      Dr. Bulling and yourself, I rather think I shall decline it.&rdquo; In spite of
      all she could do, Iola could not keep out of her voice a slightly haughty
      tone. Dr. Foxmore's sense of superiority was fast deserting him. &ldquo;And as
      to the Philharmonic solos,&rdquo; continued Iola, &ldquo;if the directors see fit to
      make me an offer of the part I shall consider it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Consider it!&rdquo; gasped Dr. Foxmore. It was time this young girl with her
      absurd pretensions were given to understand the magnitude of the favour
      that Dr. Bulling and himself were seeking to confer upon her. He became
      brutal. &ldquo;Well, all I say is that if you know when you are well off, you'll
      take this chance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Iola rose with easy grace and stood erect her full height. Dr. Foxmore had
      not thought her so tall. Her face was a shade paler than usual, her eyes a
      little wider open, but her voice was as smooth as ever, and with just a
      little ring as of steel in it she inquired, &ldquo;Did you come here this
      morning to make this threat, Dr. Foxmore?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came,&rdquo; he said bluntly, &ldquo;to let you know your good fortune and to warn
      you not to allow any of your friends to persuade you against your own best
      interests.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friends?&rdquo; Iola threw her head slightly backward and her tone became
      frankly haughty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I know your friends, and especially&mdash;I may as well be plain&mdash;that
      young medical student, Boyle, don't like Dr. Bulling, and might persuade
      you against this yacht trip.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Iola was furiously aware that her face was aflame, but she stood without
      speaking for a few moments till she was sure her voice was steady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My FRIENDS would never presume to interfere with my choosing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, they presume, or at least that young Boyle presumed, to interfere
      once too often for his own good. But he'll probably be more careful in
      future.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Boyle is a gentleman in whom I have the fullest confidence. He would
      do what he thought right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will probably correct his judgments before he interferes with Dr.
      Bulling again.&rdquo; The doctor's tone was insolently sarcastic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dr. Bulling?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. He was grossly insulting and Dr. Bulling was forced to chastise
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chastise! Mr. Boyle!&rdquo; cried Iola, her anger throwing her off her guard.
      &ldquo;That is quite impossible, Dr. Foxmore! That could not happen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I am telling you it did! I was present and saw it. It was this way&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Iola put up her hand imperiously. &ldquo;Dr. Foxmore,&rdquo; she said, recovering her
      self-command, &ldquo;there is no need of words. I tell you it is quite
      impossible! It is quite impossible!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Foxmore's face flushed a deep red. He flung aside the remaining shreds
      of decency in speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to call me a liar?&rdquo; he shouted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Dr. Foxmore, would you also chastise me as well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor stood in helpless rage looking at the calm, smiling face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was a fool to come!&rdquo; he blurted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would not presume to contradict you, nor to stand in the way of
      returning wisdom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor swore a great oath under his breath and without further words
      strode from the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Iola stood erect and silent till he had disappeared through the open door.
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she breathed, her hands fiercely clenched, &ldquo;if I were a man what a
      joy it would be just now!&rdquo; She shut the door and sat down to think. &ldquo;I
      wonder what did happen? I must see Dick at once. He'll tell me. Oh, it is
      all horribly loathsome!&rdquo; For the first time she saw herself from Dr.
      Bulling's point of view. If she sang in the Philharmonic it would be by
      virtue of his good offices and by the gracious permission of the Duff
      Charringtons. That she had the voice for the part and that it was
      immeasurably better than Evelyn Redd's counted not at all. How mean she
      felt! And yet she must go on with it. She would not allow anything to
      stand in the way of her success. This was the first firm stepping-stone in
      her climb to fame. Once this was taken, she would be independent of
      Bulling and his hateful associates. She would go on this yacht trip. She
      need not have anything to do with Dr. Bulling, nor would she, for Barney
      would undoubtedly be hurt and angry. It looked terribly like disloyalty to
      him to associate herself on terms of friendship with the man who had
      beaten him so cruelly. Oh, how she hated herself! But she could not give
      up her chance. She would explain to Barney how helpless she was and she
      would send Dick to him. He would listen to Dick.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Iola! Without knowing it, she was standing at the cross roads making
      choice of a path that was to lead her far from the faith, the ideals, the
      friends she now held most dear. Through all her years she had been
      preparing herself for this hour of choice. With her, to desire greatly was
      to bend her energies to attain. She would deeply wound the man who loved
      her better than his own life; but the moment of choice found her helpless
      in the grip of her ambition. And so her choice was made.

    <h2>
      XII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      HE THAT LOVETH HIS LIFE
    </h3>
    <p>
      Mrs. Duff Charrington at close range was not nearly so formidable as when
      seen at a distance. The huge bulk of her, the pronouncedly masculine dress
      and manner, the loud voice, the red face with its dark mustache line on
      the upper lip, all of which at a distance were calculated to overawe if
      not to strike terror to the heart of the beholder, were very considerably
      softened by the shrewd, kindly twinkle of the keen grey eyes which a
      nearer view revealed. Her welcome of Iola was bluff and hearty, but she
      was much too busy ordering her forces and disposing of her impedimenta,
      for she was her own commodore, to pay particular attention in the meantime
      to her guests. The wharf at which the Petrel was tied was crowded this
      Saturday afternoon with various parties of excursionists making for the
      steamers, ferries, yachts, and other craft that lay along the water front.
      Already the Petrel had hoisted her mainsail and, under the gentle breeze,
      was straining upon her shore lines awaiting the word to cast off. As Iola
      stood idly gazing at the shifting scene, wondering how Dick had succeeded
      on his mission to his brother, she observed Dr. Bulling approaching with
      his usual smiling assurance. Just as he was about to speak, however, she
      noticed him start and gaze fixedly toward the farther side of the wharf.
      Iola's eye, following his gaze, fell upon the figure of a man pushing his
      way through the crowd. It was Barney. She saw him pause, evidently to make
      inquiry of a dockhand. With a muttered oath, Bulling sprang to the aft
      line.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let go that line, Murdoff!&rdquo; he shouted to the man at the bow. &ldquo;Look
      lively, there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke he cast off the stern line and seized the wheel, making it
      imperative that Murdoff should execute his command in the liveliest
      manner. At once the yacht swung out and began to put a space of blue water
      between herself and the dock. She was not a moment too soon, for Barney,
      having received his direction, was coming at a run, scattering the crowd
      to right and left. As he arrived at the dock edge he caught sight of Iola
      and Dr. Bulling. He took a step backwards and made as if to attempt the
      spring. Iola's cry, &ldquo;Don't, Barney!&rdquo; arrested Mrs. Duff Charrington's
      attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's up?&rdquo; she shouted. &ldquo;How's this? We're off! Bulling, what the deuce&mdash;who
      gave orders?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Duff Charrington for once in her life was, as she would have said
      herself, completely flabbergasted. At a single glance she took in the
      white face of Iola, and that of Dr. Bulling, no less white.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's up?&rdquo; she cried again. &ldquo;Have you seen a ghost, Miss Lane? You, too,
      Bulling?&rdquo; She glanced back at the clock. &ldquo;There's someone left behind! Who
      is that young man, Daisy? Why, it's our medallist, isn't it? Do you know
      him, Bulling? Shall we go back for him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no! For Heaven's sake, no! He's a madman, quite!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me, Dr. Bulling,&rdquo; said Iola, her voice ringing clear and firm in
      contrast with Bulling's agitated tone, &ldquo;he is a friend of mine, a very
      dear friend, and, I assure you, very sane.&rdquo; As she spoke she waved her
      hand to Barney, but there was no answering sign.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your friend, is he?&rdquo; said Mrs. Duff Charrington. &ldquo;Then doubtless very
      sane. Does he want you, Miss Lane? Shall we go back for him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he doesn't want me,&rdquo; said Iola.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Charrington,&rdquo; said Dr. Bulling, &ldquo;he has a grudge against me because
      of a fancied insult.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Mrs. Duff Charrington, &ldquo;I understand. What do you say, Miss
      Lane? We can easily go back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, let us not talk about it, Mrs. Charrington,&rdquo; said Iola hurriedly; &ldquo;he
      is gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you wish, my dear. Daisy, take Dr. Bulling down to the cabin. I
      declare he looks as if he needed bracing up. I shall take the wheel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Charrington,&rdquo; said Iola in a low voice, as Bulling disappeared down
      the companionway, &ldquo;that was Mr. Boyle, my friend, and I want you to think
      him a man of the highest honour. But he doesn't like Dr. Bulling. He
      doesn't trust him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, my dear,&rdquo; said Mrs. Charrington brusquely, &ldquo;don't trouble
      yourself about him. I haven't lived fifty years for nothing. Oh! these
      men, these men! They take themselves too seriously, the dear creatures.
      But they are just like ourselves, with a little more conceit and
      considerably less wit. And they are not really worth all the trouble we
      take for them. I must get to know your medallist, my dear. That was a
      strong face and an honest face. I have heard John rave about him. John is
      my young son, first year in medicine. His judgment, I confess, is not
      altogether reliable&mdash;worships brawn, and there are traditions afloat
      as to that young man's doings when they were initiating him. But I have no
      doubt that, however sane on other subjects, he is quite mad about you,
      and, hang me! if I can wonder. If I were a young man I'd get my arms round
      you as soon as possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she chattered along, Iola found her heart warm to Mrs. Duff
      Charrington, who, with all her sporty manners and masculine ways, was an
      honest soul, with a shrewd wit and a kindly heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm glad now I came,&rdquo; said Iola gratefully; &ldquo;I was afraid you weren't&mdash;&rdquo;
       She paused abruptly in confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I'm not so bad as I'm painted, I assure you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear Mrs. Charrington, it was not you I was afraid of, it was what
      Dr. Bulling&mdash;&rdquo; Again Iola hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't bother telling me,&rdquo; said Mrs. Duff Charrington, observing her
      confusion. &ldquo;No doubt Bulling gave you to understand that he worked me to
      invite you. Confess now.&rdquo; There was a shrewd twinkle in her keen grey eye.
      &ldquo;Bulling is a liar, a terrible liar, with large possibilities of
      self-appreciation. But he had nothing to do with this invitation, though
      he flatters himself he had. He's not without ability, but he can't teach
      his grandmother to suck eggs. I'll tell you why you are here. I pride
      myself upon having an eye for a winner, and I pick you as one, and that's
      why you are to sing in the Philharmonic. Evelyn Redd has a pretty voice.
      She is a niece of a very dear friend, and for a time I thought she might
      do. But she has no soul, no passion, and music, like a man, must have
      passion. Music without passion is a crime against art. So I just told
      Duff, he's chairman, you know, of the Board of Directors, that she was
      impossible and that we must have you. I have heard you sing, my dear, and
      I know the singer's face and the singer's throat and eye. You have them
      all. You have the voice and the temperament and the passion. You'll be
      great some day, much greater than I, and, with the hope of sharing your
      glory, I have decided to put my money on you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Iola murmured some words of thanks, not knowing just what to say, but Mrs.
      Duff Charrington waved them aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Purely selfish,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;purely selfish, my dear. Now don't let
      Bulling worry you. I pick him for a winner, too. He has force. He'll be a
      power in the country. Inclines to politics. He's a kind of brute, of
      course, but he'll succeed, for he has wealth and social prestige, neither
      to be sniffed at, my child. But, especially, he has driving power. But
      I'll have my eye on him this trip, so enjoy your outing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Duff Charrington was as good as her word. She knew nothing of the
      finesse of diplomacy in the manipulation of her company. Her method was
      straightforward dragooning. Observing the persistent attempts of Dr.
      Bulling during the early part of the trip to secure Iola for a
      tete-a-tete, she called out across the deck in the ears of the whole
      company, &ldquo;See here, Bulling, I won't have you trying to monopolise our
      star. We're out for a good time and we're going to have it. Miss Lane is
      not your property. She belongs to us all.&rdquo; Thenceforth Dr. Bulling, with
      what grace he could summon, had to content himself with just so much of
      Iola's company as his hostess decided he should have.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Iola's first experience of yachting, and it brought her a series of
      sensations altogether new and delightful. As the yacht skimmed, like a
      great white-winged bird, over the blue waters of Ontario, the humming
      breeze, the swift rush through the parting waves, the sense of buoyant
      life with which the yacht seemed to be endowed made her blood jump. She
      abandoned herself to the joys of the hour and became the life and soul of
      the whole party. And were it not for Barney's haunting face, the two days'
      outing would have been for Iola among the happiest experiences of her
      life. But Barney's last look across the widening strip of water pursued
      her and filled her with foreboding. It was not rage; it was more terrible
      than rage. Iola shuddered as she recalled it. She read in it the despair
      of renunciation. She dreaded meeting him again, and as the end of her trip
      drew near her dread increased.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor did Mrs. Duff Charrington, who had become warmly interested in the
      girl during the short voyage, fail to observe her uneasiness and to guess
      the cause. Foremost among the crowd awaiting them at the dock, Iola
      detected Barney.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There he is,&rdquo; she cried under her breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; said Mrs. Duff Charrington, who was at her side, &ldquo;it is not
      possible that you are afraid, and of a man! I would give something to have
      that feeling. It is many years since a man could inspire me with any
      feeling but that of contempt or of kind pity. They are really silly
      creatures and most helpless. Let me manage him. Introduce him to me and
      leave him alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Duff Charrington's confidence in her superior powers was more than
      justified. Through the crowd and straight for Iola came Barney, his face
      haggard with two sleepless nights. By a clever manoeuvre Mrs. Duff
      Charrington swung her massive form fair in his path and, turning suddenly,
      faced him squarely. Iola seized the moment to present him. Barney made as
      if to brush her aside, but Mrs. Duff Charrington was not of the kind to be
      lightly brushed aside by anyone, much less by a young man of Barney's
      inexperience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, young man,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;I think I have seen you before.&rdquo; The
      strong grip of her hand and the loud tone of her voice at once arrested
      his progress and commanded his attention. &ldquo;I saw you get your medal the
      other day, and I have heard my young hopeful rave about you&mdash;John
      Charrington, you know, medical student, first year. He is something of a
      fool and a hero-worshipper. You, of course, won't have noticed him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barney halted, gazed abstractedly at the strong face with the keen grey
      eyes compelling his attention, then, with an effort, he collected his
      wits.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Charrington? Yes, of course, I know him. Very decent chap, too. Don't see
      much of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, rather not. He doesn't haunt the same spots. The dissecting-room
      wouldn't recognize him, I fancy. He's straight-going, however, but he
      can't pass exams. Good thing, too, for unless he changes considerably, the
      Lord pity his patients.&rdquo; She became aware of a sudden hardening in
      Barney's face and a quick flash in his eye. Without turning her head she
      knew that Dr. Bulling was approaching Iola from the other side. She put
      her hand on Barney's arm. &ldquo;Mr. Boyle, please take Miss Lane to my carriage
      there? Bulling,&rdquo; she said, turning sharply upon the doctor, &ldquo;will you help
      Daisy to collect my stuff? I am sure things will be left on the yacht.
      There are always some things left. Servants are so stupid.&rdquo; There was that
      in her voice that made Bulling stand sharply at attention and promptly
      obey. And ere Barney knew, he was leading Iola and Mrs. Duff Charrington
      to the waiting carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So sorry I didn't know you were a friend of Miss Lane's, or we would have
      had you on our trip, Mr. Boyle,&rdquo; said Mrs. Duff Charrington as he closed
      the carriage door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you. But I am very busy, and, besides, I would not fit in with
      some of your party.&rdquo; There was war in Barney's tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Heavens, young man!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Duff Charrington, in no way
      disturbed, &ldquo;you don't expect to make the world fit in with you or you with
      the world, do you? Life consists in adjusting one's self. But you will be
      glad to know that Miss Lane has made us all have a very happy little
      holiday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of that I am sure,&rdquo; cried Barney gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And we gave her, or we tried to give her, a good time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is for that some of us have lived.&rdquo; Barney's deep voice, thrilling
      with sad and tender feeling, brought the quick tears to Iola's eyes. To
      her, the words had in them the sound of farewell. Even Mrs. Duff
      Charrington was touched. She leaned over the carriage door toward him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Boyle, I am taking Miss Lane home to dinner. Come with us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barney felt the kindly tone. &ldquo;Thank you, Mrs. Charrington, it would give
      none of us pleasure, and I have much to do. I am leaving to-morrow for
      Baltimore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Iola could not check a quick gasp. Mrs. Duff Charrington glanced at her
      white face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Young man,&rdquo; she said sternly, leaning out toward him and looking Barney
      in the eyes, &ldquo;don't be a fool. The man that would, from pique, willingly
      hurt a friend is a mean and cruel coward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Charrington,&rdquo; replied Barney in a steady voice, &ldquo;I have just come
      from an operation by which a little girl, an only child, has lost her arm.
      It was the mother that desired it, not from cruelty, but from love. It is
      because it is best, that I go to-morrow. Good-bye.&rdquo; Then turning to Iola
      he said, &ldquo;I shall see you to-night.&rdquo; He lifted his hat and turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drive home, Smith,&rdquo; said Mrs. Charrington sharply; &ldquo;the others will find
      their way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take me home,&rdquo; whispered Iola, with dry lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you love him?&rdquo; said Mrs. Duff Charrington, taking the girl's hand in
      hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes. I never knew how much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tut! tut! child, the world still moves. Baltimore is not so far and he is
      only a man.&rdquo; Mrs. Duff Charrington's tone did not indicate a high opinion
      of the masculine section of humanity. &ldquo;You'll just come with me for dinner
      and then I shall send you home. Thank God, we can still eat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For some minutes they drove along in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mrs. Charrington, following up the line of her thought,
      &ldquo;that's a man for you&mdash;thinks the whole world moves round the axis of
      his own life. But I like him. He has a good face. Still,&rdquo; she mused, &ldquo;a
      man isn't everything, although once I&mdash;but never mind, there is
      always a way of bringing them to time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't know Barney, Mrs. Charrington,&rdquo; said Iola; &ldquo;nothing can ever
      change him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pish! You think so, and so, doubtless, does he. But none the less it is
      sheer nonsense. Can you tell me the trouble?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I think not,&rdquo; said Iola softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. As you like, my dear. Few things are the better for words. If
      ever you wish to come to me I shall be ready. Now let us dismiss the thing
      till after dinner. Disagreeable thoughts hinder digestion, I have found,
      and nothing is quite worth that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With such resolution did she follow her own suggestion that, during the
      drive and throughout the dinner hour and, indeed, until the moment of her
      departure, Iola was not permitted to indulge her anxious thoughts, but
      with Mrs. Duff Charrington's assistance she succeeded in keeping them deep
      in her heart under guard.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Mrs. Duff Charrington kissed her good-night she whispered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't face any issue to-night. Don't settle anything. Give time a chance.
      Time is a wonderfully wise old party.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Iola, sitting back in the carriage, decided she would act upon the
      advice which suited so thoroughly her own habit of mind. That Barney had
      made up his mind to a line of action she knew. She would set herself to
      gain time, and yet she was fearful of the issue of the interview before
      her. The fear and anxiety which she had been holding down for the last two
      hours came over her in floods. As she thought of Barney's last words she
      found herself searching wildly, but in vain, for motives with which to
      brace her strength. If he had only been angry! But that sad, tender
      solicitude in his voice unnerved her. He was not thinking of himself, she
      knew. He was, as ever, thinking of and for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      A storm of wind and rain was rapidly drawing on, but she heeded not the
      big drops driving into her face, nor did she notice that before she
      reached her door she was quite wet. She found Barney waiting for her. As
      she entered he arose and stood silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Barney!&rdquo; she exclaimed, and paused, waiting. But there was no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Barney!&rdquo; she cried again, her voice quivering, &ldquo;won't you tell me to
      come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he said, holding out his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a little cry of timid joy she ran to him, wreathed her arms about his
      neck, and clung sobbing. For some moments he held her fast, gently
      caressing with his hand her face and her beautiful hair till she grew
      quiet. Then disengaging her arms, he kissed her with grave tenderness and
      put her away from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go and take off your wet things first,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say you forgive me, Barney,&rdquo; she whispered, putting her arms again about
      his neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's not the word,&rdquo; he replied sadly; &ldquo;there's nothing to forgive. Go,
      now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She hurried away, praying that Barney's mood might not change. If she
      could only get her arms about his neck she could win and hold him, and,
      what was far more important, she could conquer herself, for great as she
      knew her love to be, she was fully aware of the hold her ambition had upon
      her and she dreaded lest that influence should become dominant in this
      hour. She knew well their souls would reach each other's secrets, and
      according to that reading the issue would be.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will keep him! I will keep him!&rdquo; she whispered to herself as she tore
      off her wet clothing. &ldquo;What shall I put on?&rdquo; She could afford to lose no
      point of vantage and she must hasten. She chose her simplest gown, a soft
      creamy crepe de chene trimmed with lace, and made so as to show the superb
      modelling of her perfect body, leaving her arms bare to the elbow and
      falling away at the neck to reveal the soft, full curves where they flowed
      down to the swell of her bosom. She shook down her hair and gathered it
      loosely in a knot, leaving it as the wind and rain had tossed it into a
      bewildering tangle of ringlets about her face. One glance she threw at her
      mirror. Never had she appeared more lovely. The dead ivory of her skin,
      relieved by a faint flush in her cheeks, the lustrous eyes, now aglow with
      passion, all set in the frame of the night-black masses of her hair&mdash;this,
      and that indescribable but all-potent charm that love lends to the face,
      she saw in her glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, God help me!&rdquo; she cried, clasping her hands high above her head, and
      went forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      These few moments Barney had spent in a fierce struggle to regain the
      mastery over the surging passion that was sweeping like a tempest through
      his soul. As her door opened he rose to meet her; but as his eyes fell
      upon her standing in the soft rose-shaded light of the room, her attitude
      of mute appeal, the rare, rich loveliness of her face and form again swept
      away all the barriers of his control. She took one step toward him. With a
      swift movement he covered his face with his hands and sank to his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O God! O God! O God!&rdquo; he groaned. &ldquo;And must I lose her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why lose me, Barney?&rdquo; she said, gliding swiftly to him and dropping to
      her knees beside him. &ldquo;Why lose me?&rdquo; she repeated, taking his head to her
      heaving bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      The touch of pity aroused his scorn of himself and braced his manhood. Not
      for himself must he think now, but for her. The touch of self makes weak,
      the cross makes strong. What matter that he was giving up his life in that
      hour if only she were helped? He rose, lifted her from her knees, set her
      in a chair, and went back to his place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Barney, let me come to you,&rdquo; she pleaded. &ldquo;I'm sorry I went&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, his voice quiet and steady, &ldquo;you must stay there. You must
      not touch me, else I cannot say what I must.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Barney,&rdquo; she cried again, &ldquo;let me explain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Explain? There is no need. I know all you would say. These people are
      nothing to you or to me. Let us forget them. It matters not at all that
      you went with them. I am not angry. I was at first insane, I think. But
      that is all past now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, Barney?&rdquo; she asked in a voice awed by the sadness and despair
      in the even, quiet tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is this,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;we have come to the end. I must not hold you
      any more. For two years I have known. I had not the courage to face it.
      But, thank God, the courage has come to me these last two days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Courage, Barney?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Courage to do right. That's it, to do right. That is what a man must
      do. And I must think for you. Our lives are already far apart and I must
      not keep you longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Barney!&rdquo; cried Iola, her voice breaking, &ldquo;let me come to you! How can
      I listen to you saying such terrible things without your arms about me?
      Can't you see I want you? You are hurting me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The pain, the terror in her voice and in her eyes, made him wince as from
      a stab. He seemed to hesitate as if estimating his strength. Dare he trust
      himself? It would make the task infinitely harder to have her near him, to
      feel the touch of her hands, the pressure of her body. But he would save
      her pain. He would help her through this hour of agony. How great it was
      he could guess by his own. He led her to a sofa, sat down beside her, and
      took her in his arms. With a long, shuddering sigh, she let herself sink
      down, with muscles relaxed and eyes closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now go on, dear,&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor girl! Poor girl!&rdquo; said Barney, &ldquo;we have made a great mistake, you
      and I. I was not made for you nor you for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to me, darling. Do I love you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With all my heart and soul?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, dear,&rdquo; she answered again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better than my own life?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Barney. Oh, yes,&rdquo; she replied with a little sob in her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now we will speak simple truth to each other,&rdquo; said Barney in a tone
      solemn as if in prayer, &ldquo;the truth as in God's sight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She hesitated. &ldquo;Oh, Barney!&rdquo; she cried piteously, &ldquo;must I say all the
      truth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must, darling. You promise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh-h-h! Yes, I promise.&rdquo; She flung her arms upward about his neck. &ldquo;I
      know what you will ask.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to me, darling,&rdquo; he said again, taking down her arms, &ldquo;this is
      what I would say. You have marked out your life. You will follow your
      great ambition. Your glorious voice calls you and you feel you must go.
      You love me and you would be my wife, make my home, mother my children if
      God should send them to us; but both these things you cannot do, and
      meantime you have chosen your great career. Is not this true?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't give you up, Barney!&rdquo; she moaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      To neither of them did it occur as an alternative that Barney should give
      up his life's work to accompany her in the path she had marked. Equally to
      both this would have seemed unworthy of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is not this true, Iola?&rdquo; Barney's voice, in spite of him, grew a little
      stern. And though she knew it was at the cost of life she could not deny
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God gave me the voice, Barney,&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, darling. And I would not hinder you nor turn you from your great
      art. So it is better that there should be no bond between us.&rdquo; He paused a
      moment as if to gather his strength together for a supreme effort. &ldquo;Iola,
      when you were a girl I bound you to me. Now you are a woman, I set you
      free. I love you, but you are not mine. You are your own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Convulsively she clung to him moaning, &ldquo;No, no, Barney!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the only way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not to-night, Barney!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, to-night. To-morrow I go to Baltimore. Trent has got me an
      appointment in Johns Hopkins. You will never forget me, but your life will
      be full again of other people and other things.&rdquo; He hurried his words,
      seeking to strike the note of her ambition and so turn her mind from her
      present pain. &ldquo;Your Philharmonic will bring you fame. That means
      engagements, great masters, and then you will belong to the great world.&rdquo;
       How clearly he had read her mind and how closely he had followed the path
      she herself had outlined for her feet! He paused, as if to take breath,
      then hurried on again as through a task. &ldquo;And we will all be proud of you
      and rejoice in your success and in your&mdash;your&mdash;your&mdash;happiness.&rdquo;
       The voice that had gone so bravely and so relentlessly through the
      terrible lesson faltered at the word and broke, but only for an instant.
      He must think of her. &ldquo;Dick will be here,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;and Margaret, and
      soon you will have many friends. Believe me, it is the best, Iola, and you
      will say it some day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Like a flash of inspiration it came to her to say, &ldquo;No, Barney, you are
      not helping me to my best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In his soul he felt that it was a true word. For a moment he had no
      answer. Eagerly she followed up her advantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;will help me up and take care of me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ah, she struck deep there. Who, indeed, would care for her, guard her
      against the world with its beasts of prey that batten their lusts upon
      beauty and innocence? And who would help her against herself? The desire
      to hold her for himself and for her sprang up fierce within him. Could he
      desert her, leave her to fight her fights, to find her way through the
      world's treacherous paths alone? That was the part of his renunciation
      that had been the heart of his pain. Not his loss, but her danger. Not his
      loneliness, but hers. For a moment he forgot everything. All the great
      love in him gathered itself together and massed its weight behind this
      desire to protect her and to hold her safe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could you, Iola,&rdquo; he cried hoarsely, &ldquo;don't you think you could let me
      care for you? Couldn't you come to me, give me the right to guard you? I
      can make wealth, great wealth, for you. Can't you come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wildly, with the incoherent logic and eloquence of great passion, he
      poured forth his soul's desire for her. To work for her, to suffer for
      her, to live for her, yes, and to give himself to her and to keep her only
      for himself! Helpless in the sweeping tide of his mighty passion, he
      poured forth his words, pleading as for his life. By an inexplicable
      psychic law the exhibition of his passion calmed hers. The sight of his
      weakness brought her strength. For one fleeting moment she allowed her
      mind to rest upon the picture his words made of a home, made rich with the
      love of a strong man, and sweet with the music of children's voices, where
      she would be safe and sheltered in infinite peace and content. But only
      for a moment. Swifter than the play of light there flashed before her
      another scene, a crowded amphitheatre of faces, tier upon tier, eager,
      rapt, listening, and upon the stage the singer holding, swaying,
      compelling them to her will. Barney felt her relaxed muscles tone up into
      firmness. The force of her ambition was being transmitted along those
      subtle spiritual nerves that knit soul and mind and body into one complex
      whole, into the very sinews and muscles of her frame. She had hold of
      herself again. She would set herself to gain time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us wait, Barney,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;let us take time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An intangible something in her tone pulled him to a sharp stop. What a
      weak fool he had been and how he had been thinking of himself! He sat up,
      straight and strong, his own man again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me, darling,&rdquo; he said, a faint, wan smile flitting across his
      face. &ldquo;I was weak and selfish. I allowed myself to think for a moment that
      it might be, but now I know we must say good-bye to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye?&rdquo; The sting of her pain made her irritable. He was so stubborn.
      &ldquo;Surely, Barney, it is unreasonable to ask me to decide at once to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rose to his feet and lifted her gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have decided. You have already chosen your life's path, and it lies
      apart from mine. Let me go quietly away.&rdquo; His voice was toneless,
      passionless. His fight of two days and two nights had left him exhausted.
      His apparent apathy chilled her to the heart. It was a supreme moment in
      their lives, and yet she could not fan her soul's fires into flame. He was
      tearing up the roots of his love out of her life, but there was no acute
      sense of laceration. The inevitable had come to pass. A silence, dense and
      throbbing, fell upon them. Outside the storm was lashing the wet leaves
      against the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If ever you should want me to come to you, Iola, one word will bring me.
      I shall be waiting, waiting. Remember that, always waiting.&rdquo; He tightened
      his arms about her and without passion, but gravely, tenderly he lifted
      her face. &ldquo;Good-bye, my love,&rdquo; he said, and kissed her lips. &ldquo;My heart's
      love!&rdquo; Once more he kissed her. &ldquo;My life! My love!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She let the full weight of her body lie in his arms, lifeless but for the
      eyes that held his fast and for the lips that gave him back his kisses.
      Gently he placed her on the couch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God keep you, darling,&rdquo; he whispered, bending over her and touching her
      dusky hair with his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found his hat, walked with unsteady feet as a man walks under a heavy
      load, her eyes following his every step, and reached the door. There he
      paused, his hand fumbling at the knob, opened the door, halted yet an
      instant, but without turning he passed out of her sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour later Margaret came in and found her sitting where Barney had left
      her, dazed and tearless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is gone,&rdquo; she said dully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret turned upon her. &ldquo;Gone? Yes. I have just seen him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I love him,&rdquo; continued Iola, looking up at her with heavy eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Love him! You don't know what love means! Love him! And for your paltry,
      selfish ambition you send from you a man whose shoes you are not worthy to
      tie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Margaret!&rdquo; cried Iola piteously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't talk to me!&rdquo; she replied, her lip quivering. &ldquo;I can't bear to look
      at you!&rdquo; and she passed into her room.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was intolerable to her that this girl should have regarded lightly the
      love she herself would have died to gain. But long after Iola had sobbed
      herself to sleep in her arms Margaret lay wakeful for her own pain and for
      that of the man she loved better than her life.
    </p>
    <p>
      But next day, as Iola was planning to go to the station, Margaret would
      not have it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should you go? You have nothing to say but what would give him pain.
      Do you want him to despise you and me to hate you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Iola was resolved to have her way. It was Mrs. Duff Charrington who
      fortunately intervened and carried Iola off with her to spend the
      afternoon and evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just a few musical friends, my dear. So brush up and come away. Bring
      your guitar with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Iola demurred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't feel like it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tut! Nonsense! The lovelorn damsel reads well in erotic novels, but
      remember this, the men don't like stale beer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This bit of worldly wisdom made Iola put on her smartest gown and lay
      aside the role she had unconsciously planned to adopt, so that even Mrs.
      Duff Charrington had no fault to find with the sparkling animation of her
      protegee.
    </p>
    <p>
      But to the three who stood together waiting for the train to pull out that
      night there was only dreary, voiceless misery. There was no pretence at
      anything but misery. To the brothers the moment of parting would be the
      end of all that had been so delightful in their old life. The days of
      their long companionship were over, and to both the thought brought grief
      that made words impossible. Only Margaret's presence forced them to
      self-control. As to Margaret, Dick alone knew the full measure of her
      grief, and her quiet, serene courage filled him with amazed admiration. At
      length came the call of the bustling, businesslike conductor, &ldquo;All
      aboard!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, Margaret,&rdquo; said Barney simply, holding out his hand. But the
      girl quietly put back her veil and lifted up her face to him, her brave
      blue eyes looking all their love into his, but her lips only said,
      &ldquo;Good-bye, Barney.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, dear Margaret,&rdquo; he said again, bending over her and kissing
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me, too, Barney,&rdquo; said Dick, his tears openly streaming down his face.
      &ldquo;I'm a confounded baby! But hanged if I care!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At Dick's words all Barney's splendid self-mastery vanished. He threw his
      arms about his brother's neck, crying &ldquo;Good-bye, Dick, old man. We've had
      a great time together; but oh, my boy, my boy, it's all come to an end!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Already the train was moving.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go, old chap,&rdquo; cried Dick, pushing him away but still clinging to him.
      And then, as Barney swung on to the step he called back to them what had
      long been in his heart to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look after her, will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Barney, we will,&rdquo; they both cried together. And as they stood gazing
      through dimming tears after the train as it sped out through the network
      of tracks and the maze of green and red lights, they felt that a new bond
      drew them closer than before. And it was the tightening of that bond that
      brought them all the comfort that there was in that hour of misery
      unspeakable.

    <h3>
      A MAN THAT IS AN HERETIC REJECT
    </h3>
    <p>
      The college year had come to an end. The results of the examinations had
      been published. The Juniors were preparing to depart for their summer work
      in the mission field. Of the graduating class, some were waiting with calm
      confidence the indications of the will of Providence as to their spheres
      of labour, a confidence undoubtedly strengthened by certain letters in
      their possession from leading members of influential congregations. Others
      were preparing with painful shrinking of heart to tread the weary and
      humiliating &ldquo;trail of the black bag,&rdquo; while others again, to whom had come
      visions of high deeds and sounds of distant battle, were making ready
      outfits supposed to be suitable for life and work in the great West, or in
      the far lands across the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two high functions of college life yet remained, one, the Presbytery
      examination, the other, Professor Macdougall's student party. The annual
      examination before Presbytery was ever an event of nerve-racking
      uncertainty. It might prove to be an entirely perfunctory performance of
      the most innocuous kind. On the other hand, it might develop features of a
      most sensational and perilous nature. The college barometer this year was
      unusually depressed, for rumour had gone abroad that the Presbytery
      examination was to be of the more serious type. It was a time of
      searchings of heart for those who had been giving, throughout the session,
      undue attention to the social opportunities afforded by college life, and
      more especially if they had allowed their contempt for the archaic and
      oriental to become unnecessarily pronounced. To these latter gentlemen the
      day brought gloomy forebodings. Even their morning devotions, which were
      marked by unusual sincerity and earnestness, failed to bring them that
      calmness of mind which these exercises are supposed to afford. For their
      slender ray of hope that their memory of the English text might not fail
      them in the hour of trial was very materially clouded by the dread that in
      their embarrassment they might assign a perfectly correct English version
      to the wrong Hebrew text. The result of such mischance they would not
      allow themselves to contemplate. On the other hand, however, there was the
      welcome possibility that they might be so able to dispose themselves among
      the orientalists in their class that a word dropped at a critical moment
      might save them from this mischance. And there was the further, and not
      altogether unreal, ground of confidence, that the examiner himself might
      be uneasily conscious of the ever-present possibility that some hidden
      Hebrew snag might rudely jag a hole in his own vessel while sailing the
      mare ignotum of oriental literature. Of course, the examination would also
      include other departments of sacred learning, for it was the province and
      duty of Presbytery to satisfy itself as to the soundness in the faith of
      the candidates before them. On this score, however, few indulged serious
      anxiety. Once the Hebraic shoals and snags were safely passed, both
      examiner and examined could disport themselves with a jaunty
      self-confidence born of a thorough acquaintance with the Shorter Catechism
      received during the plastic years of childhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was, however, just in these calm waters that danger lurked for Boyle.
      On the side of scholarship he was known to be invulnerable. Boyle was the
      hero and darling of the college men, more especially of the &ldquo;sinners&rdquo;
       among them, not simply by reason of his prowess between the goal posts
      where, times without number, he had rescued the college from the contempt
      of its foes; but quite as much for the modesty with which he carried off
      his brilliant attainments in the class lists. Throughout the term, in the
      college halls after tea, there had been carried on a series of discussions
      extending over the whole range of the &ldquo;fundamentals,&rdquo; and Boyle had the
      misfortune to rouse the wrath and awaken the concern of Finlay Finlayson,
      the champion of orthodoxy. Finlay was a huge, gaunt, broad-shouldered son
      of Uist, a theologian by birth, a dialectician by training, and a man of
      war by the gift of Heaven. Cheerfully would Finlay, for conscience' sake,
      have given his body to the flames, as, for conscience' sake, he had shaken
      off the heretical dust of New College, Edinburgh, from his shoes,
      unhesitatingly surrendering at the same time, Scot though he was, a
      scholarship of fifty pounds. The hope that he had cherished of being able
      to find, in a colonial institution of sacred learning, a safe haven where
      he might devote himself to the perfecting of the defences of his faith
      within the citadel of orthodoxy was rudely shattered by the discovery that
      the same heresies which had driven him from New College had found their
      way across the sea and were being championed by a man of such winning
      personality and undoubted scholarship as Richard Boyle. The effect upon
      Finlayson's mind of these discussions carried on throughout the term was
      such that, after much and prayerful deliberation, and after due notice to
      the person immediately affected, he discovered it to be his duty to inform
      the professor in whose department these subjects lay of the heresies that
      were threatening the very life of the college, and, indeed, of the
      Canadian Church.
    </p>
    <p>
      The report of his interview with the professor came back to college
      through the realistic if somewhat irreverent medium of the professor's
      son, Tom, presently pursuing a somewhat leisurely course toward a medical
      degree. As Tom appeared in the college hall he was immediately surrounded
      by an eager crowd, the most eager of whom was Robert Duff, the sworn ally
      of Mr. Finlayson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did Finlayson see your father?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Duff anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure thing,&rdquo; answered Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And did he inform him of what has been going on in this college?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bet your life! Give him the whole tip!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what did the professor say?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Duff, with bated breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Told him to go to the devil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To what?&rdquo; gasped Mr. Duff, to whom it appeared for the moment that the
      foundations of things in heaven and on earth had indeed been removed. It
      was only after the shout of laughter on the part of the &ldquo;sinners&rdquo; had
      subsided that Mr. Duff realised that it was the spirit only, and not the
      ipsissima verba, of the devout and reverent professor, that had been
      translated in the vigorous vernacular of his son.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unhappily, however, for Boyle, the report of his heretical tendencies had
      reached other ears than those of the sane and liberal-minded professor,
      those, namely, of that stern and rigid churchman, the Rev. Alexander
      Naismith, some time minister of St. Columba's. Not through Finlayson,
      however, be it understood, did this report reach him. That staunch
      defender of orthodoxy might, under stress of conscience, find it his duty
      to inform the proper authority of the matter, but sooner than retail
      gossip to the hurt of his fellow-student he would have cut off his big,
      bony right hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Rev. Alexander Naismith was a little man with a shrill voice, which
      gained for him the cognomen of &ldquo;Squeaky Sandy,&rdquo; and a most irritatingly
      persistent temper. Into his hands, while candidates and examiners were
      disporting themselves in the calm waters of Systematic Theology, fell poor
      Dick, to his confusion and the temporary withholding of his license. It
      was impossible but that in the college itself, and in the college circles
      of society, this event should become a subject of much heated discussion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Professor Macdougall's student parties were not as other student parties.
      They were never attended from a sense of duty. This was undoubtedly due,
      not so much to the popularity of the professor with his students, as to
      the shrewd wisdom and profound knowledge of human nature generally and of
      student nature particularly, on the part of that gentle lady, the
      professor's wife. Mrs. Macdougall was of the old school, with very
      beautiful if very old-fashioned notions of propriety. Her whole life was
      one poetic setting forth of the manners and deportment proper to ladies,
      both young and old. But none the less her shrewd mother wit and kindly
      heart instructed her in things not taught in the schools. The consequence
      was that, while she herself sat erect in fine scorn of the backs of her
      straight-backed Sheratons, her drawing-room was furnished with an
      abundance of easy chairs and lounges, and arranged with cosey nooks and
      corners calculated to gratify the luxurious tastes and lazy manners of a
      decadent generation. Her shrewd wit was further discovered in the care she
      took to assemble to her evening parties the prettiest, brightest,
      wickedest of the young girls in the wide circle of her friends. As young
      Robert Kidd put it with more vigour than grace, &ldquo;There were no last roses
      in her bunch.&rdquo; Moreover, the wise little lady took pains to instruct her
      young ladies as to their duties toward the young men of the college.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must exert yourselves, my dears,&rdquo; she would explain, &ldquo;to make the
      evening pleasant for the young men. And they require something to distract
      their attention from the too earnest pursuit of their studies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And it is a tradition that so heartily did the young ladies throw
      themselves into this particular duty that there were, even of the
      saintliest of the saints, who found it necessary to take their lectures in
      absentia for at least two days in order that they might recover from the
      all too successful distractions of the Macdougall party.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the guests invited was Margaret, beloved for her own sake, but even
      more for the sake of her mother, who had been Mrs. Macdougall's college
      companion and lifelong cherished friend. The absorbing theme of
      conversation, carried on in a strictly confidential manner, was the
      sensational feature of the Presbytery examination. The professor himself
      was deeply grieved, and no less so his stately little lady, for to both of
      them Dick was as a son. But from neither of them could Margaret extract
      anything but the most meagre outline of what had happened. For full
      details of the whole dramatic scene she was indebted to Robert Kidd,
      second year theologue, whose brown curly locks and cherubic face and fresh
      innocence of manner won for him the sobriquet of &ldquo;Baby Kidd,&rdquo; or more
      shortly, &ldquo;Kiddie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell us just what happened,&rdquo; entreated Miss Belle Macdougall, with a
      glance of such heart-penetrating quality that Kiddie promptly acquiesced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'll tell you,&rdquo; he said, adopting a low confidential tone. &ldquo;I could
      see from the very start that old Squeaky Sandy was out after Dick. He
      couldn't get him on his Hebrew, so the old chap lay low till everything
      was lovely and they were falling on each others' necks over the Shorter
      Catechism, and things every fellow is supposed to be quite safe on. All at
      once Sandy squeaked in, 'Mr. Boyle, will you kindly state what you
      consider the correct theory of the Atonement?' 'I don't know,' said Boyle;
      'I haven't got any.' By Jove! everyone sat up. 'You believe in the
      doctrine, I suppose?' Boyle waited a while and my heart stopped till he
      went on again. 'Yes, sir, I believe in it.' 'How is that, sir? If you
      believe in it you must have a theory. What do you believe about it?' 'I
      believe in the fact. I don't understand it, and I have no theory of it as
      yet.' And Boyle was as gentle as a sucking dove. Then the Moderator,
      decent old chap, chipped it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was it?&rdquo; inquired Miss Belle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dr. Mitchell. Fine old boy. None too sound himself, I guess. Pre-mill,
      too, you know. Well, he chipped in and got him past that snag. But old
      Sandy was not done yet by a long shot. He went after Boyle on every
      doctrine in the catalogue where it was possible for a man to get off the
      track, Inspiration, Inerrancy, the Mosaic Authorship, and the whole
      Robertson Smith business. You know that last big heresy hunt in Scotland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Miss Belle, &ldquo;I don't know. And you don't, either, so you
      needn't stop and try to tell us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't, eh?&rdquo; said Bob, who was finding it difficult to keep himself in a
      perfectly sane condition under the bewildering glances of Miss Belle's
      black eyes. &ldquo;Well, perhaps I don't. At any rate, I couldn't make you
      understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hear him!&rdquo; said Miss Belle, with supreme scorn. &ldquo;Go on. We are interested
      in Boyle, aren't we, Margaret?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, where was I? Oh, yes. Well, sir, in about five minutes it seemed to
      me that Boyle's theology was a tattered remnant. Some of the brethren
      interfered, explaining and apologizing for the young man after their
      kindly custom, but Squeaky wouldn't have it. 'This is most serious, Mr.
      Moderator!' he sung out. 'This demands the most searching investigation!
      We all know what is going on in the Old Land, how the great doctrines of
      our faith are being undermined by so-called scholarship, which is nothing
      less than blasphemy and impudent scepticism.' And so he went on shrieking
      more and more wildly a lot of tommy-rot. But the worst was yet to come.
      All at once Sandy changed his line of attack and proceeded to take Boyle
      on the flank. 'Mr. Boyle, are you a smoker?' he asked. 'Yes,' stammered
      poor Boyle, getting red in the face, 'I smoke some.' 'Are you a total
      abstainer?' And then Boyle got on to him, and I saw his head go back for
      the first time. Before this he had been sitting like a convicted criminal.
      'No, sir,' he answered, turning square around and facing old Squeaky, 'I
      am not pledged to total abstinence.' Don't suppose he ever took a drink in
      his life. 'Did you ever attend the theatre?' This was the limit. It seemed
      to strike the brethren all at once what the old inquisitor was driving at.
      The words were hardly out of his mouth when there was a weird sound, a
      cross between a howl and a roar, and Grant was at the Moderator's desk. It
      will always be a mystery to me how he got there. There were three pews
      between him and the desk, and I swear he never came out into the aisle.
      'Mr. Moderator, I protest', he shouted. And then the dust began to fly.
      Say! it was a regular sand storm! About the only thing visible was the
      lightning from Grant's eyes. By Jingo! 'Mr. Moderator, I protest,' he
      cried, when he could get a hearing, 'against these insinuations. We all
      know what Mr. Naismith means by this method of inquisition. But let me
      tell Mr. Naismith&mdash;' Don't know what in thunder he was going to tell
      him, for the next few moments they mixed it up good and hot. Say! it was a
      circus with all the monkeys loose and the band playing seventeen tunes all
      at once! But finally Grant had his say and treated the Presbytery to a
      pretty full disquisition of his own theology, and when he was done my pity
      was transferred from Boyle to him, for it seemed that on every doctrine
      where Boyle was a heretic Grant had gone him one better. And I believe the
      whole Presbytery were vastly relieved to discover how slight, by contrast,
      were the errors to which Boyle had fallen. Then Henderson, good old soul,
      took his innings and poured on oil, with the result that Boyle was turned
      over to a committee&mdash;and that's where he is now. But he'll never
      appear. He's going in for journalism. The Telegraph wants him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Journalism?&rdquo; cried Margaret faintly. She was thinking of the dark-faced
      old lady up in the country who was counting the days till her son should
      be sent forth a minister of the Gospel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Kiddie. &ldquo;And there's where he'll shine. See what he's done
      with the Monthly. He's got great style. But wasn't there a row at the
      college!&rdquo; continued Kiddie. &ldquo;Old Father Finlayson there,&rdquo; nodding across
      the room at the Highlander, who was engaged in what appeared to be an
      extremely interesting conversation with his hostess, &ldquo;orthodox old beggar
      as he is, was ready to lead a raid on Squeaky Sandy's house. You know he
      has been at war with Boyle all winter on every and all possible themes.
      But he fights fair, and this hitting below the belt was too much for him.
      He was raging up and down the hall like a wild man when Boyle came in.
      'Mr. Boyle,' he roared, rushing up to him and seizing him by the hand and
      working it like a pump-handle in a fire, 'it was a most iniquitous
      proceeding! I wish to assure you I have no sympathy whatever with that
      sort of thing!' And so he went on till he had Boyle almost in tears. By
      Jove! he's a rum old party! Look at his socks, will you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young ladies glanced across and beheld in amused but amazed horror the
      Highlander's great feet encased in a new pair of carpet slippers adorned
      with pink roses and green ground, which made a startling contrast with his
      three-ply worsted stockings, magenta in colour, which his fond aunt had
      knit as part of his outfit for the Arctic regions of Canada.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may laugh,&rdquo; continued Bob. &ldquo;So would I yesterday. But, by Jingo! he
      can wear magenta socks on his head if he likes for me! He's all white, and
      he has the heart of a gentleman!&rdquo; Little Kidd's voice went shaky and his
      eyes had the curious shine that appeared in them only in moments of
      deepest excitement, but if he had only known it, he had never been so near
      storming the gate of Miss Belle's heart as at that moment. She showed her
      sympathy with Kiddie's attitude by giving Mr. Finlayson &ldquo;the time of his
      life,&rdquo; as Kiddie himself remarked. So assiduously, indeed, did she devote
      herself to the promotion of Mr. Finlayson's comfort and good cheer that
      that gentleman's fine sense of honour prompted him to inform her
      incidentally of the existence of Miss Jennie McLean, who was to &ldquo;come out
      to him as soon as he was placed.&rdquo; He was surprised, but entirely
      delighted, to discover that this announcement made no difference whatever
      in Miss Belle's attentions. At the supper hour, however, Miss Belle, moved
      by Kiddie's lugubrious countenance, yielded her place to Margaret, who
      continued the operation of giving Mr. Finlayson &ldquo;the time of his life.&rdquo;
       But not a word could she extract from him regarding the heresy case, for,
      with a skill that might have made a Queen's Counsel green with envy, he
      baffled her leading questions with a density of ignorance unparalleled in
      her experience, until she let it be known that Dick was an old schoolmate
      and dear friend. Then Mr. Finlayson poured forth the grief and rage
      swelling in his big heart at the treatment his enemy had received and his
      anxious concern for his future both here and hereafter. In a portion of
      this concern, at least, Margaret shared. And as Mr. Finlayson continued to
      unburden himself, during the walk home, regarding the heresies in
      Edinburgh from which he had fled and the heresies that had apparently
      taken possession of Dick's mind, her heart continued to sink within her,
      for it seemed that the opinions attributed to Dick were subversive of all
      she had held true from her childhood. With such intelligence and sympathy,
      however, did she listen to Mr. Finlayson discoursing, that that gentleman
      carried back with him to college a heart somewhat lightened of its burden,
      but withal seriously impressed with the charm and the mental grasp of the
      young ladies of Canada. And so enthusiastically did he dwell upon this
      theme in his next letter, that Miss Jessie McLean set herself devoutly to
      pray, either that Finlayson might soon be placed, or that the professors
      might cease giving parties.
    </p>
    <p>
      The brand of heresy almost invariably works ill to him who bears it. For
      if he be young and shallow enough to enjoy the distinction, it will only
      increase his vanity and render his return to sure and safe paths more
      difficult. But if his doubts are to him a grief and a horror of darkness,
      the brand will burn in and drive him far from his fellows, and change the
      kindly spirit in him to bitterness unless, perchance, he light upon a
      friend who gives him love and trust unstinted and links him to wholesome
      living. After all, in matters of faith every man must blaze his own path
      through the woods and make his own clearing in which to dwell. And he may
      well thank God if his path lead him some whither where there is space
      enough to work his day's work and light enough to live by.
    </p>
    <p>
      With Dick it was mostly dark, for it was not given him to have a friend
      who could understand. But he was not allowed to feel himself to be quite
      abandoned, for in the darkest of his hours there stood at his side
      Margaret Robertson, whose strong, cheery good sense and whose loyalty to
      right-doing helped him and strengthened him and so made it possible to
      wait till the better day dawned.

      The Journalistic World has its own diversity of mountain and plain, and
      its own variety of inhabitants. There are its mountain ranges and upland
      regions of clear skies and pure airs, where are wide outlooks and horizons
      whose dim lines fade beyond the reach of clear vision. Amid these mountain
      ranges and upon these uplands dwell men among the immortals to whom has
      come the &ldquo;vision splendid&rdquo; and whose are the voices that in the crisis of
      a man or of a nation give forth the call that turns the face upward to
      life eternal and divine. To these men such words as Duty, Honour,
      Patriotism, Purity, stand for things of intrinsic value worth a man's
      while to seek and, having found, to die for.
    </p>
    <p>
      Level plains there are, too, where harvests are sown and reaped. But there
      these same words often become mere implements of cultivation, tools for
      mechanical industries or currency for the conduct of business. Here dwell
      the practical men of affairs, as they love to call themselves, for whom
      has faded the vision in the glare of opportunism.
    </p>
    <p>
      And far down by the water-fronts are the slum wastes where the sewers of
      politics and business and social life pour forth their fetid filth. Here
      the journals of yellow shade grub and fatten. In this ooze and slime
      puddle the hordes of sewer rats, scavengers of the world's garbage, from
      whose collected stores the editor selects his daily mess for the
      delectation of the great unwashed, whether of the classes or of the
      masses, and from which he grabs in large handfuls that viscous mud that
      sticks and stings where it sticks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Daily Telegraph was born yellow, a frank yellow of the barbaric type
      that despises neutral tints. By the Daily Telegraph things were called by
      their uneuphemistic names. A spade was a spade, and mud was mud, and
      nothing was sacred from its sewer rats. The highest paid official on its
      staff was a criminal lawyer celebrated in the libel courts. Everybody
      cursed it and everybody read it. After a season, having thus firmly
      established itself in the enmities of the community, and having become, in
      consequence, financially secure, it began to aspire toward the uplands,
      where the harvests were as rich and at the same time less perilous as well
      as less offensive in the reaping. It began to study euphemism. A spade
      became an agricultural implement and mud alluvial deposit. Having become
      by long experience a specialist in the business of moral scavenging, it
      proceeded to devote itself with most vehement energy to the business of
      moral reform. All indecencies that could not successfully cover themselves
      with such gilding as good hard gold can give were ruthlessly held up to
      public contempt. It continued to be cursed, but gradually came to be
      respected and feared.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was to aid in this upward climb that the editor of the Daily Telegraph
      seized upon Dick. That young man was peculiarly fitted for the part which
      was to be assigned to him. He was a theological student and, therefore,
      his ethical standards were unimpeachable. His university training
      guaranteed his literary sense, and his connection with the University and
      College papers had revealed him a master of terse English. He was the very
      man, indeed, but he must serve his apprenticeship with the sewer rats. For
      months he toiled amid much slime and filth, breathing in its stinking
      odours, gaining knowledge, it is true, but paying dear for it in the
      golden coin of that finer sensibility and that vigorous moral health which
      had formerly made his life, to himself and to others, a joy and beauty.
      For the slime would stick, do what he could, and with the smells he must
      become so familiar that they no longer offended. That delicate
      discrimination that immediately detects the presence of decay departed
      from him, and in its place there developed a coarser sense whose
      characteristic was its power to distinguish between sewage and sewage.
      Hence, morality, with him, came to consist in the choosing of sewage of
      the less offensive forms. On the other hand, consciousness of the brand of
      heresy drove him from those scenes where the air is pure and from
      association with those high souls who by mere living exhale spiritual
      health and fragrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We do not see much of Mr. Boyle these days, Margaret,&rdquo; Mrs. Macdougall
      would say to her friend, carefully modulating her tone lest she should
      betray the anxiety of her gentle, loyal heart. &ldquo;But I doubt not he is very
      busy with his new duties.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he is very busy,&rdquo; Margaret would reply, striving to guard her voice
      with equal care, but with less success. For Margaret was cursed, nay
      blessed, with that heart of infinite motherhood that yearns over the
      broken or the weak or the straying of humankind, and makes their pain its
      own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bring him with you to tea next Sabbath evening, my dear,&rdquo; the little lady
      would say, with never a quiver or inflection of voice betraying that she
      had detected the girl's anxiety for her friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      But more infrequently, as the days went on, could she secure Dick for an
      hour on Sabbath evening in the quiet, sweet little nook of the professor's
      dining-room. He was so often held by his work, but more often by his
      attendance upon Iola, for between Iola and him there had grown up and
      ripened rapidly an intimacy that Margaret regarded with distrust and fear.
      How she hated herself for her suspicions! How she fought to forbid them
      harbour in her heart! But how persistently they made entrance and to
      abide.

      The World of Fashion is, for the most part, a desert island of gleaming
      sands, at times fanned by perfume-laden zephyrs and lapped by shining
      waters. Then those who dwell there disport themselves, careless of all
      save the lapping, shining waters and the gleaming sands out of which they
      build their sand castles with such concentrated eagerness and such painful
      industry. At other times there come tempests, sudden and out of clear
      skies, which sweep, with ruthless besom, castles and castle-builders
      alike, and leave desolation and empty spaces for a time.
    </p>
    <p>
      A silly world it is, and hard of heart, and like to die of ennui at times.
      And hence it welcomes with pathetic joy all who can bring some new fancy
      or trick to their castle-building, rejecting all other without remorse. To
      this World of Fashion Iola had offered herself, giving freely her great
      voice and her superb body, now developed into the full splendour of its
      rich and sensuous beauty. And how they gathered about her and gave her
      unstinted their flatteries and homage, taking toll the while of the very
      soul-stuff in her. Devoutly they worshipped at the shrine of that
      heavenlike and heaven-given instrument wherewith she could tickle their
      senses, rejoicing, during the pauses of their envies and hatreds, such
      among them as were female, and of their lusts and despairs such as were
      male, in her warm flesh tints and full flesh curves and the draperies
      withal wherewith, with consummate art, she revealed or enhanced the same.
      For Iola was possessed of a fatal, maddening beauty, and an alluring
      fascination of manner that wrought destruction among men and fury among
      women.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Dick, who, with his brilliant talents, shed lustre upon her courts,
      Iola gave chief place in her train, yet in such manner as that her
      preference for him neither lessened the number nor checked the ardour of
      her devotees. He was her friend of childhood days, her good friend, but
      nothing more. Upon this basis of a boy and girl friendship was established
      an intimacy which seemed to render unnecessary those conventions, unreal
      and vexing in appearance, but which, as the wise old world has proved, man
      and woman with the dread potencies of passion slumbering within them
      cannot afford to despise. By their mutual tastes, as by their habits of
      life, Iola and Dick were brought into daily association. Under Dick's
      guidance she read and studied the masters of the English drama. For she
      had her eye now upon the operatic stage and was at present devoting
      herself to the great musical dramas of Wagner. Together they took full
      advantage of the theatre privileges which Dick's connection with the press
      gave him. And at those festive routs by which society amuses and vexes
      itself they were constantly thrown together. Dick was acutely and
      growingly sensitive to the influence Iola had upon him. Her beauty
      disturbed him. The subtle potency that exhaled from her physical charms
      affected him like draughts of wine. Away from her presence he marvelled at
      himself and scorned his weakness; but once within sound of her voice,
      within touch of her hand, her power reasserted itself. The mystery of the
      body, its subtle appeal, its terrible potency, allured and enslaved him.
      Against this infatuation of Dick's, Margaret felt herself helpless. She
      well knew that Dick's love for her had not changed, except to grow into a
      bitter, despairing intensity that made his presence painful to her at
      times. This very love of his closed her lips. She could only wait her
      time, meanwhile keeping such touch with him as she could, bringing to him
      the wholesome fragrance of a pure heart and the strength and serenity of a
      life devoted to well doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something would occur to recall him to his better self. And something did
      occur. Almost a year had elapsed since Barney had gone out of Iola's life
      in so tragic a way. Through all the months of the year he had waited,
      longing and hoping for the word that might recall him to her, until
      suspense became unbearable even for his strong soul. Hence it was that
      Iola received from him a letter breathing of love so deep, so tender, and
      withal so humble, that even across the space that these months had put
      between Barney and herself, Iola was profoundly stirred and sorely put to
      it to decide upon her answer. She took the letter to Margaret and read her
      such parts as she thought necessary. &ldquo;A year has gone. It seems like ten.
      I have waited for your word, but none has come. Looking back upon that
      dreadful night I sometimes think I may have been severe. If so, my
      punishment has been heavy enough to atone. Tell me, shall I come to you? I
      can offer you a home even better than I had hoped a year ago. I am offered
      a lectureship here with an ample salary, or an assistantship on equal
      terms, by Trent. I have discovered that I am in the grip of a love beyond
      my power to control. In spite of all that my work is to me, I find myself
      looking, not into the book before me, but into your eyes&mdash;I may be
      able to live without you, but I cannot live my best. I don't see how I can
      live at all. It seems as if I could not wait even a few days for your word
      to come. Darling, my heart's love, tell me to come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can I answer a letter like that?&rdquo; said Iola to Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo; exclaimed Margaret. &ldquo;Tell him to come. Wire him. Go to him.
      Anything to get him to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Iola mused a while. &ldquo;He wants me to marry him and to keep his house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Margaret, &ldquo;he does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Housekeeping and babies, ugh!&rdquo; shuddered Iola.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; cried Margaret, &ldquo;ah, God, yes! Housekeeping and babies and Barney!
      God pity your poor soul!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Iola shrank from the fierce intensity of Margaret's sudden passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Why do you speak so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? Can't you read God's meaning in your woman's body and in your
      woman's heart?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From Margaret Iola got little help. Indeed, the gulf between the two was
      growing wider every day. She resolved to show her letter to Dick. They
      were to go that evening to the play and after the play there would be
      supper. And when he had taken her home she would show him the letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      On their way home that evening as they were passing Dick's rooms, he
      suddenly remembered that a message was to be sent him from the office.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us run in for a moment,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I had better wait you here,&rdquo; replied Iola.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; cried Dick. &ldquo;Don't be a baby. Come in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Together they entered and, laying aside her wrap, Iola sat down and drew
      forth Barney's letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, Dick. I want your advice.&rdquo; And she read over such portions of
      Barney's letter as she thought necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; she said, as Dick remained silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied Dick, &ldquo;what's your answer to be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know what he means,&rdquo; said Iola a little impatiently. &ldquo;He wants me to
      marry him at once and to settle down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Dick, &ldquo;why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Dick,&rdquo; cried Iola, &ldquo;do you think I am suited for that kind of life?
      Can you picture me devoting myself to the keeping of a house tidy, the
      overseeing of meals? I fancy I see myself spending the long, quiet
      evenings, my husband busy in his office or out among his patients while I
      dose and yawn and grow fat and old and ugly, and the great world
      forgetting. Dick, I should die! Of course, I love Barney. But I must have
      life, movement. I can't be forgotten!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgotten?&rdquo; cried Dick. &ldquo;Why should you be forgotten? Barney's wife could
      not be ignored and the world could not forget you. And, after all,&rdquo; added
      Dick, in a musing tone, &ldquo;to live with Barney ought to be good enough for
      any woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, how eloquent you are, Dick!&rdquo; she cried, making a little moue. &ldquo;You
      are quite irresistible!&rdquo; she added, leaning toward him with a mocking
      laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, let us go,&rdquo; said Dick painfully, conscious of her physical charm.
      &ldquo;We must get away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you haven't helped me, Dick,&rdquo; she cried, drawing nearer to him and
      laying her hand upon his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      The perfume of her hair smote upon his senses. The beauty of her face and
      form intoxicated him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew he was losing control of himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Iola,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;let us go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me what to say, Dick,&rdquo; she replied, smiling into his face and
      leaning toward him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can I tell you?&rdquo; cried Dick desperately, springing up. &ldquo;I only know
      you are beautiful, Iola, beautiful as an angel, as a devil! What has come
      over you, or is it me, that you should affect me so? Do you know,&rdquo; he
      added roughly, lifting her to her feet, his breath coming hard and fast,
      &ldquo;I can hardly keep my hands off you. We must go. I must go. Come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor child,&rdquo; mocked Iola, still smiling into his eyes, &ldquo;is it afraid it
      will get hurt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop it, Iola!&rdquo; cried Dick. &ldquo;Come on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; she mocked, still leaning toward him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Swiftly Dick turned, seized her in his arms, his eyes burning down upon
      her mocking face. &ldquo;Kiss me!&rdquo; he commanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gradually she allowed the weight of her body to lean upon him, drawing him
      steadily down toward her the while, with the deep, passionate lure of her
      lustrous eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kiss me!&rdquo; he commanded again. But she shook her head, holding him still
      with her gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God in heaven!&rdquo; cried Dick. &ldquo;Go away!&rdquo; He made to push her from him. She
      clasped him about the neck, allowing herself to sink in his arms with her
      face turned upward to his. Fiercely he crushed her to him, and again and
      again his hot, passionate kisses fell upon her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conscious only of the passion throbbing in their hearts and pulsing
      through their bodies, oblivious to all about them, they heard not the
      opening of the door and knew not that a man had entered the room. For a
      single moment he stood stricken with horror as if gazing upon death
      itself. Turning to depart, his foot caught a chair. Terror-smitten, the
      two sprang apart and stood with guilt and shame stamped upon their ghastly
      faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Barney!&rdquo; they cried together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly he came back to them. &ldquo;Yes, it is I.&rdquo; The words seemed to come from
      some far distance. &ldquo;I couldn't wait. I came for my answer, Iola. I thought
      I could persuade you better. I have it now. I have lost you! And&rdquo;&mdash;here
      he turned to Dick&mdash;&ldquo;oh, my God! My God! I have lost my brother, too!&rdquo;
       he turned to depart from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Barney,&rdquo; cried Dick passionately, &ldquo;there was no wrong! There was nothing
      beyond what you saw!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was that all?&rdquo; inquired his brother quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As God is in heaven, Barney, that was all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barney threw a swift glance round the room, crossed to a side table, and
      picked up a Bible lying there. He turned the leaves rapidly and handed it
      to his brother with his finger upon a verse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You know your Bible. Read!&rdquo; His voice was terrible and
      compelling in its calmness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Following the pointing finger, Dick's eyes fell upon words that seemed to
      sear his eyeballs as he read, &ldquo;Whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after
      her, hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.&rdquo;
       Heart-smitten, Dick stood without a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could kill you now,&rdquo; said the quiet, terrible voice. &ldquo;But what need? To
      me you are already dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Dick looked up his brother had gone. Nerveless, broken, he sank into
      a chair and sat with his face in his hands. Beside him stood Iola, pale,
      rigid, her eyes distended as if she had seen a horrid vision. She was the
      first to recover.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dick,&rdquo; she said softly, laying her hand upon his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sprang up as if her fingers had been red-hot iron and had burned to the
      bone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't touch me!&rdquo; he cried in vehement frenzy. &ldquo;You are a devil! And I am
      in hell! In hell! do you hear?&rdquo; He caught her by the arm and shook her.
      &ldquo;And I deserve hell! Hell! Hell! Fools! no hell?&rdquo; He turned again to her.
      &ldquo;And for you, for this, and this, and this,&rdquo; touching her hair, her cheek,
      and her heaving bosom with his finger, &ldquo;I have lost my brother&mdash;my
      brother&mdash;my own brother&mdash;Barney. Oh, fool that I am! Damned!
      Damned! Damned!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shrank back from him, then whispered with pale lips, &ldquo;Oh, Dick, spare
      me! Take me home!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; he cried in mad haste, &ldquo;anywhere, in the devil's name! Come!
      Come!&rdquo; He seized her wrap, threw it upon her shoulders, caught up his hat,
      tore open the door for her, and followed her out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can a man take fire into his bosom and not be burned?&rdquo; And out of the
      embers of his passion there kindled a fire that night that burned with
      unquenchable fury for many a day.

    <h3>
      THE SUPERINTENDENT'S METHODS
    </h3>
    <p>
      The Superintendent was spending the precious hours of one of his rare
      visits at home in painful plodding through his correspondence. For it was
      part of the sacrifice his work demanded, and which he cheerfully made,
      that he should forsake home and wife and children for his work's sake. The
      Assembly's Convener found him in the midst of an orderly confusion of
      papers of different sorts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do, sir?&rdquo; The Superintendent's voice had a fine burr about it
      that gripped the ear, and his hand a vigour and tenacity of hold that
      gripped the outstretched hand of the Assembly's Convener and nearly
      brought the little man to the floor. &ldquo;Sit down, sir, and listen to this.
      Here are some of the compensations that go with the Superintendent's
      office. This is rich. It comes from my friend, Henry Fink, of the Columbia
      Forks in the Windermere Valley. British Columbia, you understand,&rdquo;
       noticing the Convener's puzzled expression. &ldquo;I visited the valley a year
      ago and found a truly deplorable condition of things. Men had gone up
      there many years ago and settled down remote from civilization. Some of
      them married Indian wives and others of them ought to have married them,
      and they have brought up families in the atmosphere and beliefs of the
      pagans. Would you believe it, I fell in with a young man on the trail,
      twenty years of age, who had never heard the name of our Saviour except in
      oaths? He had never heard the story of the Cross. And there are many
      others like him. At the Columbia Forks the only institution that stands
      for things intellectual is a Freethinkers' Club, the president of which is
      a retired colonel of the British Army, a man of fine manners, of some
      degree of intelligence and reading, but, I have reason to believe, of bad
      life. His is the dominant influence in the community if we except my
      friend, Mr. Henry Fink, or, as he is known locally, 'Hank Fink.' Hank is a
      character, I assure you. A Yankee from the Eastern States, the son of a
      Scotch mother. Has a cattle ranch, runs a store which supplies the
      scattered ranchers, prospectors, and miners with the necessaries of life,
      and keeps a stopping place. Is postmaster, too. In fact, Hank is pretty
      much the whole village. He has lived in that country some fifteen years.
      Has a good Canadian wife, and a flock of small children. He is a rara avis
      in that country from the fact that he hates whiskey. He hates it almost as
      much as he does Colonel Hicks and his Freethinking Club. When I visited
      the village, for some reason or other Hank took me up, the Scotch blood in
      him possibly recognising kinship. He gave me his store to preach in, took
      me all about the country, and in a week had a mission organized on a sound
      financial basis. His methods were very simple, very direct, and very
      effective. He estimated the amount each man should pay and announced this
      fact to the man, who generally acquiesced. I didn't probe too deeply into
      Hank's motives, but it seemed to give him considerable satisfaction to
      learn that Colonel Hicks was filled with indignant and scornful rage at
      the proposal to establish a Christian mission in that remote valley. It
      grieved the Colonel to think that after so many years of immunity they
      should at last be called upon to tolerate this particularly offensive
      appendage to an effete civilization. I noticed that Hank's English always
      broke down in referring to the Colonel. Well, we sent in Finlayson a year
      ago this spring, you remember. Strong man, good preacher, conscientious
      fellow. Thought he would do great work. You know Finlayson? Well, this is
      the result.&rdquo; Here he picked up Hank's letter. &ldquo;This would hardly do for
      the Home Mission report,&rdquo; continued the Superintendent, with a twinkle in
      his keen grey eyes:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;COLUMBIA FORKS, WINDERMERE, B. C.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DEAR SIR:&mdash;I take my pen to write you a few lines to let you know
      how things is goin'. Well, sir, I want to tell you this station is goin'
      to the devil. [Judging from what I saw of the place, it hadn't far to go.]
      Your preacher ain't worth a cuss. I don't say he ain't good fer some
      people, but he ain't our style. [Mr. Finlayson would doubtless agree with
      that.] He means well, but he ain't eddicated up to the West. You remember
      how we got the boys all corralled up nice an' tame when you was here.
      Well, he's got 'em wild. Couldn't reach 'em with a shotgun. He throwed
      hell fire at 'em till they got scart an' took to the hills till you can't
      get near 'em no more'n mountain goats. So they have all quit comin'&mdash;I
      don't count Scotty Fraser, for he would come, anyway&mdash;except me an'
      Monkey Fiddler an' his yeller dog. You can always count on the dog. Now,
      sir, this is your show, not mine. But I was born an' raised a Presbyteryn
      down East, an' though I haven't worked hard at the business for some
      years, it riles me some to hear Col. Hicks an' a lot of durned fools that
      has got smarter than God Almighty Himself shootin' off against the Bible
      an' religion an' all that. [We needn't read too closely between the lines
      at this point.] Send a man that don't smell so strong of sulphur an'
      brimstone, who has got some savey, an' who will know how to handle the
      boys gentle. They ain't to say bad, but just a leetle wild. Send him
      along, an' we will stay with him an' knock the tar out of that bunch of
      fools.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yours most respeckfully,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;HENRY FINK.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;P. S. When are you comin' into the valley again? If you could arrange to
      spend a month or two I'll guarantee we will have 'em all in nice shape.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yours respeckfully,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;HENRY FINK.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think you can count much from the support of a man like that,&rdquo;
       said the assembly's Convener; &ldquo;I don't think he shows any real interest in
      the work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear sir,&rdquo; said the Superintendent, &ldquo;don't you know he is the Chairman
      of our Board of Management, a most regular attendant upon ordinances and
      contributes most liberally to our support? And while these things in the
      East wouldn't necessarily indicate a change of heart, they stand for a
      good deal west of the Great Divide. And, at any rate, in these matters we
      remember gratefully the word that is written, 'He that is not against us
      is on our part.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; said the Assembly's Convener, &ldquo;it may be so. It may be so.
      But what's to be done with Finlayson? And where will you get a successor
      for him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can easily place Finlayson. He is a good man and will do excellent
      work in other fields. But where to get a man for Windermere is the
      question. Do you know anyone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Assembly's Convener shook his head sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There appears to be no one in sight,&rdquo; said the Superintendent. &ldquo;I have a
      number of applications here,&rdquo; picking up a good-sized bundle of neatly
      folded papers, &ldquo;but they are hardly the kind to suit conditions at
      Windermere. Numbers of them feel themselves specially called of God to do
      mission work in large centres of population. Others are chiefly anxious
      about the question of support. One man would like to be in touch with a
      daily train service, as he feels it necessary to keep in touch with the
      world by means of the daily newspaper. A number are engaged who want to be
      married. Here's Mr. Brown, too fat. No move in him. Here's McKay&mdash;good
      man, earnest, but not adaptable, like Finlayson; won't do. Here's Garton&mdash;fine
      fellow, would do well, but hardly strong enough. So what are you to do? I
      have gone over the whole list of available men and I cannot find one
      suitable for Windermere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In this the Assembly's Convener could give him no help. Indeed, from few
      did the Superintendent receive assistance in the securing of men for his
      far outposts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Assistance came to him from an unexpected quarter. He was to meet the
      Assembly's Convener and some members of the Committee that evening at
      Professor Macdougall's for tea. The Superintendent's mind could not be
      kept long away from the work that was his very life, and at the table the
      conversation turned to the question of the chronic difficulty of securing
      men for frontier work, which had become acute in the case of Windermere.
      Margaret, who had been invited to assist Mrs. Macdougall in the dispensing
      of her hospitality, was at once on the alert. Why could not Dick be sent?
      If only that Presbytery difficulty could be got over he might go. That he
      would be suited for the work she was well assured, and equally certain was
      she that it would be good for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would save him,&rdquo; Margaret said to herself with a sharp sting at her
      heart, for she had to confess sadly that Dick had come to the point where
      he needed saving. She had learned from Iola the whole miserable story of
      Barney's visit, of his terrible indictment of his brother and the final
      break between them, but she had seen little of him during the past six
      months. From that terrible night Dick had gone down in physical and in
      moral health. Again and again he had written Barney, but there had been no
      reply. Hungrily he had come to Margaret for word of his brother, hopeful
      of reconciliation. But of late he had given up hope and had ceased to make
      inquiry, settling down into a state of gloomy, remorseful grief into which
      Margaret felt she dare not intrude. He occasionally met Iola at society
      functions, but there was an end of all intimacy between them. His only
      relief seemed to be in his work, and he gave himself to that with such
      feverish energy that his health broke down, and under Margaret's
      persuasion he was now at home with his mother. Thence he had written once
      to say that his days were one long agony. She remembered one terrible
      sentence. &ldquo;Everything here, the house, the mill, my father's fiddle, my
      mother's churn, the woods, the fields, everything, everything shrieks
      'Barney' at me till I am like to go mad. I must get away from here to some
      place where he has never been with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It required some considerable skill to secure the Superintendent that
      evening for a few minutes alone. In whatever company he was, he was easily
      the centre of interest. But Margaret, even in the early days of the Manse,
      had been a favourite with him, and he was not a man to forget his friends.
      He had the rare gift of gripping them to him with &ldquo;hooks of steel.&rdquo; Hence,
      he had kept in touch with her during the latter years, pitying the girl's
      loneliness as much as his admiration for her cheery courage and her
      determined independence would allow him. When Margaret found her
      opportunity she wasted no time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a man for you for Windermere,&rdquo; were her opening words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have? Where have you got him? Who is he? And are you willing to spare
      him? Few young ladies are. But you are different from most.&rdquo; The
      Superintendent was ever a gallant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You remember Mr. Boyle who graduated a year ago?&rdquo; Her words came
      hurriedly and there was a slight flush on her cheek. &ldquo;There was some
      trouble about his license at Presbytery. That horrid old Mr. Naismith was
      very nasty, and Dick, Mr. Boyle, I mean&mdash;we have always been
      friends,&rdquo; she hastened to add, explaining her deepening blush, &ldquo;you know
      his mother lived at the Mill near us. Well, since that day in Presbytery
      he has never been the same. His work&mdash;he is on the Daily Telegraph,
      you know&mdash;takes him away from&mdash;from&mdash;well, from Church and
      that kind of thing, and from all his friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; said the Superintendent, with grave sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he's got to be very different. He had some trouble, great trouble,
      the greatest possible to him. Oh, I may as well tell you. The brothers&mdash;you
      remember the doctor, Barney?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; replied the Superintendent. &ldquo;Strong man. Where is he now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He went to Europe. Well, the brothers were everything to each other since
      little fellows together. Oh, it was beautiful! I never saw anything like
      it anywhere. They had a misunderstanding, a terrible misunderstanding.
      Dick was in the wrong.&rdquo; The Superintendent shot a keen glance at her.
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, answering his glance, the colour in her face deepening
      into a vivid scarlet, &ldquo;it was not about me, not at all. I can't tell you
      about it, but that, and his trouble with the Presbytery, and all the rest
      of it are just killing him. And I know if he got back to his own work
      again and away from home it would save him, and his mother, too, for she
      is breaking her heart. Couldn't you get him out there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Superintendent saw how hard a task it had been for her to tell the
      story, and the sight of her eager face, the big blue eyes bright, and the
      lips quivering with the intensity of her feeling, deeply touched him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It might be possible,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I know the Presbytery difficulty,&rdquo; cried Margaret, with a desperate
      note in her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That could be arranged, I have no doubt,&rdquo; said the Superintendent,
      brushing aside that difficulty with a wave of the hand. &ldquo;The question is,
      would he be willing to go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he would go, I am sure. If you saw him and if you told him those
      stories about the need there is, I am sure he would go. Could you see him?
      There is no use to write. I do wish you could. He is such a fine boy and
      his mother is so set upon his being a minister.&rdquo; The blue eyes were bright
      with tears she was too brave to let fall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear young lady,&rdquo; said the Superintendent, his deep voice growing
      deeper under the intensity of his feelings, &ldquo;I would do much for your sake
      and for your mother's. I am to visit your home early next month. I shall
      make it a point to see Mr. Boyle, and I promise you I shall get him if it
      is possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sudden lifting of the burden from her heart deprived the girl of
      speech, but she shyly put out her hand and touched the long, sinewy
      fingers that lay within reach of hers in a timid caress. Instantly the
      fingers closed upon her hand in a grasp so strong that it seemed to drive
      the conviction into her heart that somehow this strong man would find a
      way by which Dick could be saved.
    </p>
    <p>
      How, or by what arguments, the Superintendent overcame Dick's objections,
      Margaret never learned. But the full bitter tale of reasons against his
      ever taking up his work again, with which Dick had made himself so
      familiar during the past dark, dreary months, were one by one removed, and
      when the Superintendent left the Old Stone Mill he had secured his
      missionary for Windermere. It gave the Superintendent acute satisfaction
      to remember the flash of his missionary's blue eyes as, in answer to the
      warning, &ldquo;You will have a hard fight of it, remember,&rdquo; the reply came, &ldquo;A
      hard fight? Thank God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before the year was over it fell that the Windermere valley came to be one
      of the mission fields that gladdened the hearts of the Home Mission
      Committee of the Calgary Presbytery, and especially of its doughty
      Convener. In the Convener's study, eight by ten, the report from the
      Windermere field was discussed with the ubiquitous and indefatigable
      Superintendent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An extremely gratifying record,&rdquo; said the Superintendent, &ldquo;especially
      when one considers its disorganized condition a year ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it's a good report,&rdquo; assented the Convener. &ldquo;We had practically no
      support a year ago. Our strongest man&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fink?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. You know Hank, I see. Well, Hank's enthusiasm and devotion were
      hardly of what you would call the purest type. But whatever his motive, he
      stood by the missionary, and, do you know, it is a splendid testimony of
      the power of the Gospel to see the change in that same shrewd old sinner.
      Yes, sir, give the Gospel a chance and it will do its work.&rdquo; The Convener,
      who hated all cant and canting phrases with a perfect hatred, rarely
      allowed himself the luxury of an emotional outbreak. But the case of Hank
      Fink seemed to reach the springs of feeling that he kept hidden in the
      deep heart of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So Boyle has done well?&rdquo; said the Superintendent. &ldquo;I am very glad of it.
      Very glad of it, for his own sake, for his mother's, and for the sake of
      another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the Convener, &ldquo;Boyle has done a fine bit of work. He lived
      all summer on his horse's back and in his canoe, followed the prospectors
      up into the gulches and the miners to their mines, if you can call them
      mines, left a magazine here, a book there, a New Testament next place. And
      once he got his grip on a man, he never let him go. Hank told me how he
      found a man sick in a camp away up in a gulch and how he stayed with him
      for more than a week, then brought him down on his horse's back to the
      Forks. Yes, it's a good record. A church built at the north end of the
      field, another almost completed at the Forks. Really, it was very fine,&rdquo;
       continued the Convener, allowing his enthusiasm to rise. &ldquo;It renews one's
      faith in the reality of religion to see a man jump into his work like
      that. They didn't pay him his salary the first half year, but he omitted
      to mention that in his report.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Superintendent sat up straight. &ldquo;Is he behind yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I mentioned the matter to Fink and explained that if the field failed
      it was Boyle that would suffer. His language&mdash;well,&rdquo; the Convener
      laughed reminiscently, &ldquo;you have seen Hank?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I've seen him, I've heard him, and I've read him. But let us hope
      that his deeds will atone in a measure for his broken English. But,&rdquo;
       continued the Superintendent, &ldquo;you have had Boyle ordained, have you not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. We got him ordained,&rdquo; replied the Convener, beginning to chuckle. A
      delighted, choking chuckle it was. Any missionary who had worked in his
      Presbytery would recognize the Convener in the dark by that chuckle. It
      began, if one were quick to observe, with a wrinkling about the corners of
      the sharp blue eyes, then became audible in a succession of small
      explosions that seemed to have their origin in the region of the esophagus
      and to threaten the larynx with disruption, until relief was found in a
      wide-throated peal that subsided in a second series of small explosions
      and gradually rumbled off into silence somewhere in the region of the
      diaphragm, leaving only the wrinkles about the corners of the blue eyes as
      a kind of warning that the whole process might be repeated upon sufficient
      provocation. &ldquo;Yes, we got him ordained,&rdquo; he repeated when the chuckle had
      passed. &ldquo;I was glad of your explanatory note about him. It guided us in
      our arrangements for examination.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; inquired the Superintendent, leaning forward. He dearly
      loved a yarn, and he sorely hated to lose any of the more humorous
      incidents of missionary life, not only for the joy they brought him, but
      also because they furnished him with ammunition for his Eastern campaigns.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it was funny,&rdquo; said the Convener, his lips twitching and his eyes
      wrinkling, &ldquo;though at one time it looked like an Assembly case with all
      seven of us up before the bar. You know McPherson, our latest importation
      in the way of ordained men? Somehow he had got wind of Boyle's trouble
      with the Presbytery in the East. McPherson is a fine fellow and doing good
      work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; assented the Superintendent, &ldquo;he's a fine fellow, but his
      conscience gives him a hard time now and then and works over time for
      other People.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; continued the Convener, &ldquo;McPherson came to me about the matter in
      very considerable anxiety. I put him off, consulted with McTavish and
      Murray, and we decided that Boyle was too good a man to lose, and as to
      his heresy, it was not hurting Windermere as far as we could learn. So it
      happened&rdquo;&mdash;here the Convener pulled himself up short to suppress the
      chuckle that threatened&mdash;&ldquo;it happened that just as the examination
      was beginning McPherson was called out, and before he had returned the
      trials for license and ordination had been sustained. I think on the whole
      McPherson was relieved, but there were some funny moments after he came
      back into court.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heresy-hunting doesn't flourish in the West,&rdquo; said the Superintendent.
      &ldquo;There's no time for it. Some of the Eastern Presbyteries have too many
      men with more time on their hands than sense in their heads.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly there was no time lost in this case,&rdquo; replied the Convener. &ldquo;We
      knew Boyle's scholarship was right. We knew his heart was sound. We knew
      he was doing good work for us and we knew we wanted him. We were not
      anxious to know anything else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What we want for the West,&rdquo; said the Superintendent, his voice vibrating
      in a deeper tone, &ldquo;is men who have the spirit of the Gospel with the power
      to preach it and the love of their fellowmen, with tact to bring it to
      bear upon them. A little heresy, more or less, won't hurt them. Orthodoxy
      is my doxy, heterodoxy the other fellow's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In Boyle's case, I believe he was helped by his touch of heresy. It gave
      him a kind of brotherly feeling with all heretics. It was that more than
      anything else that broke up the Freethinkers' Club.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said the Superintendent, bending eagerly forward, again on the
      scent, &ldquo;I didn't hear that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the Convener, &ldquo;Fink told me about it. Boyle went to their
      meetings. He found them revelling in cheap scepticism of the Ingersollian
      type. He took the attitude of a man seeking after a working theory of
      life, and that attitude he stuck to&mdash;his real attitude, mind you. He
      encouraged them to talk, combated none of their positions and, as Hank
      said, 'coaxed them out into deep water and had them froggin' for their
      lives. He was the biggest Freethinker in the bunch.' They invited him to
      give a series of lectures. He did so, and that settled the Freethinkers'
      Club. He never blamed them for doubting anything, and I believe that's
      right.&rdquo; The Convener was a bit of a heretic himself and, consequently,
      carried a tender heart toward them. &ldquo;Let a man doubt till he finds his
      faith. And that was Boyle's line. He let them doubt, but he insisted that
      they should have something positive to live by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our friend Hank,&rdquo; said the Superintendent, &ldquo;would be delighted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Delighted? I should say so. But Hank 'joins trembling with his mirth,'
      for Boyle got after him with the same demands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Superintendent was filled with delighted pride in his missionary.
      &ldquo;That's the kind of man we want. He ought to do well in your railroad
      field.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the Convener hesitatingly. &ldquo;You think he ought to go?
      Windermere will be furious. I wouldn't care to go in there after Boyle is
      removed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is hard on Windermere, but Windermere mustn't be selfish. That
      railroad work is most pressing, and only a man like Boyle will do. There
      will be from three to five thousand men in there this winter between
      Macleod and Kuskinook. We dare not neglect them. I have had correspondence
      with Fahey, the General Manager for the Crow's Nest line, and he is not
      unfriendly, though he would prefer us to send in medical missionaries. But
      that work he and his contractors ought to look after.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a terrible state of things in the eastern division, I fear, from
      all reports,&rdquo; replied the Convener. &ldquo;By the way, there is a young English
      doctor working on that eastern division from the MaCleod end who is making
      a great stir. Bailey is his name, I believe. He began as a navvy, but
      finding a lot of fellows sick, and the doctor a poor drunken fellow,
      Bailey, it appears, stood it as long as he could, then finally threw him
      out of the camp and installed himself in his place. The contractor backed
      him up and he has revolutionized the medical work in that direction.
      Murray told me the most wonderful tales about him. He must be a remarkable
      man. Gambles heavily, but hates whiskey and won't have it near the camp.
      You ought to look him up when you go in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will. These camp doctors are a poor lot and the railroad people ought
      to feel disgraced in employing them. They draw their fifty cents per man a
      month, but their practice is shameful. It is a delicate matter, but I
      shall take this up with Fahey when I see him. He is a rough diamond, but
      he is fair and he won't stand any nonsense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you think Boyle ought to go in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. On the whole, I think Boyle must go. These are a fine body of men
      and must be looked after. A weaker man would make a mess of things. Boyle
      is the man for the work. How did he seem? Cheerful?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I shouldn't call him so. But he is vastly better than when he came to
      us. He was low in health, I think, and his face haunted me for weeks. He
      strikes me as a man with a tragedy in his life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Superintendent said nothing. He had, in large degree, the rare gift of
      silence. Even with his trusted lieutenants he would break no confidence.
      But before he slept that night he wrote two letters, and after he had
      sealed and stamped them he placed them, with a pile already written, on
      the table and sat back in his chair indulging himself in a few moments of
      reverie. He saw the orderly, well-kept kitchen in the Old Stone Mill and,
      bending over his letter a woman, dark-faced and stern, her wavy, black
      hair heavily streaked with white, for during the past years the sword had
      pierced her heart. He saw the light break upon her tragic Highland face as
      she read of her boy and his well doing. With glad heart she had given him
      up, and now, with humble joy, she would read that her offering had been
      accepted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other letter brought to him the Macdougalls' drawing-room with all its
      beautiful appointments and the face of a young girl pleading for her
      friend. He still could see the quivering lips and hear the words of her
      invincible faith, &ldquo;I know that if he got at his own work again it would
      save him.&rdquo; He could still feel the grateful, timid pressure of her fingers
      as he had pledged her his word that her desire should be fulfilled. He had
      kept his word and her faith had not been put to shame.

    <h3>
      THE CHALLENGE OF DEATH
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be aisy now, ye little divils. Sure ye'd think it wuz the ould Nick
      himself ye're dodgin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus Tommy Tate, teamster along the Tote road between the Maclennan camps,
      admonished his half-broken bronchos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stiddy now. The saints be good t'us! Will we iver git down this hill
      alive? Hould back, will yez? There, now. The saints be praised! that's
      over. How are ye now, Scotty? If ye're alive, kick me fut. Hivin be
      praised! He's there yit,&rdquo; said Tommy to himself. &ldquo;We're on the dump now,
      Scotty, an' we won't be long, me bhoy, till we see the lights av Swipey's
      saloon. Git along there, will ye!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The bronchos after their fifteen-mile drive along the unspeakable bush
      roads, finding the smooth surface of the railway grade beneath their feet,
      set off at a good lope. It was now quite dark. The snow was driving
      bitterly in Tommy's face, but that stout little Irishman cared nothing for
      himself. His concern was for the man lying under the buffalo robes in the
      sleigh. Mile after mile the bronchos kept up their tireless lope,
      encouraged by the cheery admonitions and the cracking whip of their
      driver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Begob, but it's cowld enough to freeze the tail aff a brass monkey. I'll
      jist be afther givin' the lad a taste.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He tied the reins to the seat, gave his bronchos a parting lash, took a
      flask from his pocket, and got down on his knees beside the sick man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, Scotty,&rdquo; he said coaxingly, &ldquo;take another taste. It'll put life
      into ye.&rdquo; The sick man tried to swallow once, twice, choked hard, then
      shook his head. &ldquo;Now, God be merciful! an' can't ye swally at all? An' the
      good stuff it is, too! Thry once more, Scotty darlin'. Ye'll need it an'
      we're not far aff now.&rdquo; Once more the sick man made a desperate effort. He
      got a little of the whiskey down, then turned away his head. The
      tender-hearted little Irishman covered him over carefully and climbed into
      his seat. &ldquo;He couldn't swally it,&rdquo; he said to himself in an awed voice,
      putting the flask to his own lips, &ldquo;Begorra, an' it's near the Kingdom he
      must be!&rdquo; To Tommy it appeared an infallible sign of approaching
      dissolution that a man should reject the contents of his flask. He gave
      himself to the business of getting out of the bronchos all the speed they
      had. &ldquo;Come on, now, me bhoys!&rdquo; he shouted through the gale, &ldquo;what are ye
      lookin' at? Sure, there's nothin' purtier than yerselves can be seen in
      the dark. Hut, there! Kick, wud ye? Take that, thin, an' larn manners! Now
      ye're beginin' to move! Hooray!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So with voice and lash Tommy continued to urge his team till they came out
      into a clearing at the far end of which twinkled the lights of the new
      railroad town being built about Maclennan's camp No. 1.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hivin be praised! we're there at last. Begob, it's mesilf that thought
      ye'd moved to the ind of nowhere. We're here, Scotty, me man. In ten howly
      minutes we'll have ye by the fire an' the docthor puttin' life into ye wid
      a spoon. Are ye there, Scotty?&rdquo; But there was no movement in response.
      &ldquo;Howly Mary! Give us a little more speed!&rdquo; He stood up over his team,
      lashing and yelling till the tired beasts were going at full gallop. As he
      drew near the camp the sound of singing came on the driving wind. &ldquo;Now the
      divil fly away wid the whiskey! It's pay day an' the camp's loose. God
      send, there's a quiet spot to be found near at hand!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Through the driving snow could be seen the dim, black outlines of the
      various structures of the pioneer town. First came the camp building, the
      bunkhouse, grub-house, office, blacksmith shop, and beyond these the
      glaring lights of a couple of saloons, while back nearer timber the &ldquo;red
      lights,&rdquo; the curse and shame of railroad, lumber, and mining camps in
      British Columbia then and unto this day, cast their baleful lure through
      the snowy night.
    </p>
    <p>
      At full gallop Tommy drove his bronchos up to the door of the first saloon
      and before they were well stopped burst open the door, crying out, &ldquo;Give
      us a hand here, min, for the love o' God!&rdquo; Swipey, the saloon-keeper, came
      himself to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you there, Tommy?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's mesilf don't know. It wuz alive when we started out. Are ye there,
      Scotty?&rdquo; There was no answer. &ldquo;The saints be good to us! Are ye alive at
      all?&rdquo; He lifted back the buffalo robe from the sick man's face and he
      found him breathing heavily, but unable to speak. &ldquo;Where's yer doctor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven't seen him raound,&rdquo; said Swipey. &ldquo;Have you, Shorty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the man called Shorty. &ldquo;He's in there with the boys.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tommy swore a great oath. &ldquo;Like our own docthor, he is, the blank, dirty
      suckers they are! Sure, they'd pull a bung hole out be the roots!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's not that way,&rdquo; replied Swipey, &ldquo;our doctor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not much he ain't!&rdquo; cried Shorty. &ldquo;But he's into the biggest game with
      'Mexico' an' the boys ye ever seen in this camp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fer the love av Hivin git him!&rdquo; cried Tommy. &ldquo;The man is dyin'. Here,
      min, let's git him in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's no place here for a sick man,&rdquo; said the saloon-keeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? He's dyin', I'm tellin' ye!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, this ain't no place to die in. We ain't got time.&rdquo; An angry murmur
      ran through the men about the door. &ldquo;Take him up to the bunk-house,&rdquo; said
      the saloon-keeper to Tommy with a stream of oaths. &ldquo;What d'ye want to come
      monkeyin' raound my house for with a sick man? How do you know what he's
      got?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What differ does it make what he's got?&rdquo; retorted Tommy. &ldquo;Blank yer dirty
      face fer a bloody son of a sheep thief! It's plinty of me money ye've had,
      but it's no more ye'll git! Where'll I take the man to?&rdquo; he cried,
      appealing to the crowd. &ldquo;Ye can't let him die on the street!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meantime Shorty had found the doctor in a small room back of the bar of
      the &ldquo;Frank&rdquo; saloon, seated at a table surrounded by six or eight men with
      a deck of cards in his hand, deep in a game of &ldquo;Black Jack&rdquo; for which he
      held the pot. Opposite him sat &ldquo;Mexico,&rdquo; the type of a Western
      professional gambler and desperado, his swarthy face adorned with a pair
      of sweeping mustaches, its expressionless appearance relieved by a pair of
      glittering black eyes. For nine hours the doctor had not moved from his
      chair, playing any who might care to chip in to the game. For the last
      hour he had been winning heavily, till, at his right hand, he had a heap
      of new crisp bills lately from the Bank of Montreal, having made but a
      slight pause in the grimy hands of the railroad men on their way to his.
      At his left hand stood a glass of water with which, from time to time, he
      moistened his lips. His face was like a mask of death, colourless and
      empty of feeling, except that in the black eyes, deep-set and blood-shot,
      there gleamed a light as of madness. The room was full of men watching the
      game and waiting an opportunity to get into it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The doctor's wanted!&rdquo; shouted Shorty, bursting into the room. Not a head
      turned, and but for a slight flicker of impatience the doctor remained
      unmoved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's a man dyin' out here from No. 2,&rdquo; continued Shorty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him go to hell, then, an' you go, too!&rdquo; growled out &ldquo;Mexico,&rdquo; who had
      for the greater part of the evening been playing in bad luck, but who had
      refused to quit, waiting for the turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's out here in the snow,&rdquo; continued Shorty, &ldquo;an' he's chokin' to death,
      an' we don't know what to do with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor looked up from his hand. &ldquo;Put him in somewhere. I'll be along
      soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They won't let him in anywhere. They're all afraid, an' he's chokin' to
      death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor turned down his cards. &ldquo;What do you say? Choking to death?&rdquo; He
      passed his hand over his eyes. His professional instinct began to assert
      itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; continued Shorty. &ldquo;There's somethin' wrong with him; he can't
      swallow. An' we can't git him in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor pushed back his chair. &ldquo;Here, men,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I'm going to
      quit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A chorus of oaths and imprecations greeted his proposal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can't quit now!&rdquo; growled &ldquo;Mexico&rdquo; fiercely, like a dog that is about
      to lose a bone. &ldquo;You've got to give us a chance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, here's your chance then,&rdquo; cried the doctor. &ldquo;Let's stop this
      tiddle-de-winks game. You can't have up more than a hundred apiece. I'll
      put my pile against your bets, there's three thousand if there's a dollar,
      and quit. Come on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The greatness of the opportunity staggered them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they flung themselves upon it. &ldquo;It's a go!&rdquo; &ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; &ldquo;Give us your
      cards!&rdquo; Quickly the cards were dealt. One by one the men made up their
      hands. The crowd about crushed in upon them in breathless excitement.
      Never had there been seen in that camp so reckless a stake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, then, show down,&rdquo; growled &ldquo;Mexico.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor laid down his cards face up. One by one they compared their
      hands. He had won. With an oath &ldquo;Mexico&rdquo; made a grab for the pile,
      reaching for his hip at the same time with the other hand, but the doctor
      was first, and before anyone could move or speak &ldquo;Mexico&rdquo; was lying in the
      corner, his toes quivering above his upturned chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look after the brute, someone. He doesn't understand the game,&rdquo; said the
      doctor with cool contempt, crumpling up the bills and pushing them down
      into his pocket. &ldquo;Where's your sick man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This way, doctor,&rdquo; said Shorty, hurrying out toward the sleigh. The
      doctor passed him on a run.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does this mean?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Why haven't you got him inside
      somewhere?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's what I say, docthor,&rdquo; answered Tommy, &ldquo;but the bloody haythen
      wudn't let him in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How's this, Swipey?&rdquo; said the doctor sternly, turning to the
      saloon-keeper, who still stood in the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's not comin' in here. How do I know what he's got?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll take that responsibility,&rdquo; replied the doctor. &ldquo;In he goes. Here,
      take him up on the robe, men. Steady, now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Swipey hesitated a moment, but before he could make up his mind what to
      do, the doctor was leading his men with their burden past the bar door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Show us a room at the back, Swipey, upstairs. It must be warm. Be quick
      about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Swearing deep oaths, Swipey led the way. &ldquo;It must be warm, eh? Want a bath
      in it next, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This will do,&rdquo; said the doctor when they reached the room. &ldquo;Now, clear
      out, men. I want one of you. You'll do, Shorty.&rdquo; Without hurry, but with
      incredible speed and dexterity, he had the man undressed and in bed
      between heated blankets. &ldquo;Now, hold the light. We'll take a look at his
      throat. Heavens above! Stay here, Shorty, till I come back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He ran downstairs, and, bareheaded as he was, plunged through the storm to
      his office, returning in a few minutes with his medical bag and two
      hot-water bottles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We're too late, Shorty, I fear, but we'll do our best. Get these full of
      hot water for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, Doctor?&rdquo; cried Shorty anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go quick!&rdquo; The doctor's voice was so sharp and stern that before Shorty
      knew, he was half way downstairs with the hot-water bottles. With swift,
      deft movements the doctor went about his work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, that's right. Now, Shorty, hold the light again. Now the antitoxin.
      It's hours, days, too late, perhaps, hardly any use with this mixed
      infection, but we'll try it. There. Now we'll touch up his heart. Poor
      chap, he can't swallow. We'll give it to him this way.&rdquo; Again he filled
      his syringe from another bottle and gave the sick man a second injection.
      &ldquo;There. That ought to help him a bit. Now, what fool sent a man in this
      condition twenty miles through a storm like this? Shorty, don't let that
      teamster go away without seeing me. Have him in here within an hour.&rdquo;
       Shorty turned to go. &ldquo;Wait. Do you know this man's name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard Tommy call him Scotty Anderson. He's from the old country, I
      think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. Now, go and get the teamster.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor turned to his struggle with death. &ldquo;There is no chance, no
      chance. The fools! The villains! It's sheer murder!&rdquo; he muttered, as he
      strove moment by moment to bring relief to the sick man fighting to get
      his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      After working with him for half an hour the doctor had the satisfaction of
      seeing him begin to breathe more easily. But by that time he had given up
      all hope of saving the man's life. And it seemed to increase his rage to
      see his patient slipping away from him. For do what he could, the heart
      was failing rapidly and the doctor saw that it was simply a matter of
      minutes. Before the hour had elapsed the dying man opened his eyes and
      looked about. The doctor turned up the light and leaned over him, trying
      to make out the words which poor Scotty was making such painful efforts to
      utter. But no words could he hear. Finally the dying man pointed to the
      chair on which his clothes lay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You want something out of your pocket?&rdquo; inquired the doctor. The eyes
      gave assent. One by one the doctor held up the articles he found in the
      pockets of the clothing till he came to a letter, then the eyes that had
      followed every movement expressed satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you want me to read it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was from the mother to her son Andy in far Canada, breathing gratitude
      for gifts of money from time to time, pride in his well doing, love
      without measure, and prayers unceasing. It took all the doctor's fortitude
      to keep his voice clear and steady. The eloquent eyes never moved from his
      face till the reading was finished. Then the doctor put the letter into
      his big, hairy hand so muscular and so feeble. The fingers closed upon it
      and with difficulty carried it to the man's bosom. For a moment the eyes
      remained closed as if in peace, but only for a moment. Once more they
      rested entreatingly upon the doctor's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something else in your pocket?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor continued drawing forth the articles one by one till he came to
      a large worn pocketbook.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With an effort the head nodded an affirmation. From the innermost pocket
      he drew a little photograph of a young girl. A light came into the eyes of
      the dying man. He took the photograph which the doctor placed in his hand
      and carried it painfully to his lips. Once more the eyes began to
      question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You want something else from your pocketbook? If so, close your eyes.&rdquo;
       The eyes remained wide open. &ldquo;No? You want me to do something for you? To
      write?&rdquo; At once the eyes closed. &ldquo;I shall write to your mother and send
      all your things and tell them about you.&rdquo; A smile spread over the face and
      the eyes closed as if content. In a few minutes, however, they opened wide
      again. In vain the doctor tried to catch the meaning. The lips began to
      move. Putting his ear close, the doctor caught the word &ldquo;Thank.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank who? The teamster?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man moved his hand and touched the doctor's with his fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank me? My dear fellow, I only wish I could help you,&rdquo; said the doctor.
      &ldquo;Anything else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The eyes looked upward toward the ceiling, then rested beseechingly upon
      the doctor's face again. Vainly the doctor sought to gather his meaning,
      till, with a mighty effort, poor Scotty tried to speak. Once more, putting
      his ear close to the lips, the doctor caught the words, &ldquo;Mother&mdash;home,&rdquo;
       and again the eyes turned upward toward the ceiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wish me to tell your mother that you are going home?&rdquo; And once more a
      glad smile lit up the distorted face.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some minutes there was silence in the room. Up from the bar, through
      the thin partition, came the sounds of oaths and laughter and drunken
      song. The doctor cursed them all below his breath and turned toward the
      door. A spasm of coughing brought him back to his patient's side. After
      the spasm had passed the sick man lay still, his eyes closed, and his
      breath becoming shorter every moment. Once again the eyes made their
      appeal, and the doctor hastened to seek their meaning. Listening intently,
      he heard the word, &ldquo;Pray.&rdquo; The doctor's pale face flushed quickly and as
      quickly paled again. He shook his head, saying, &ldquo;I'm no good at that.&rdquo;
       Once more the poor lips made an effort to speak, and again the doctor
      caught the words, &ldquo;Jesus, tender&mdash;.&rdquo; It had been the doctor's child
      prayer, too. But for years no prayer had passed his lips. He could not
      bring himself to do it. It would be sheer mockery. But the eyes were fixed
      upon his face beseeching, waiting for him to begin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said the doctor through his set teeth, &ldquo;I'll do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And above the ribald sounds that broke in from below on the solemn
      silence, the doctor's voice, low but very clear, rose in the verses of
      that ancient child's prayer, &ldquo;Jesus, tender Shepherd, hear me.&rdquo; At the
      third verse,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Let my sins be all forgiven,
        Bless the friends I love so well,
      Take me when I die to heaven,
        Happy there with Thee to dwell.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      there was a deep breath from the sick man, a sigh as of great content, and
      then all was still. Ere the prayer had been uttered the answer had come,
      &ldquo;Happy there with Thee to dwell.&rdquo; Poor Scotty! Out from the sickness and
      the pain, from the wretchedness and the sin, he had been taken to the
      place where the blessed dwell and whence they go no more out forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Silently the doctor composed the limbs, his eyes dim with unusual tears.
      As he was thus busied he heard a sniffle behind him and, turning sharply
      about, he found Tommy and Shorty standing at the door, both wiping their
      eyes and struggling with their sobs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Confound you, Shorty!&rdquo; burst forth the doctor wrathfully, &ldquo;what in the
      mischief are you doing there? Come in, you fool. Did you ever see a dead
      man before?&rdquo; The doctor was clearly in a rage. During the weeks Shorty had
      known him in camp he had never seen him show anything but a perfectly cold
      and self-composed face. &ldquo;Is this the teamster?&rdquo; continued the doctor.
      &ldquo;Come in here. You see that man? Someone has murdered him. Who sent him
      down here through this storm? How long had he been ill? Have you a doctor
      up there? Are there any more sick? Why don't you speak up? What's your
      name?&rdquo; In an angry flood the questions poured forth upon the hapless
      Tommy, who stood speechless. &ldquo;Why don't you speak?&rdquo; said the doctor again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recovering himself, Tommy began with the question which seemed to require
      least thought to answer. &ldquo;Thomas Tate, sir, av ye plaze. An' sure it's not
      me ye'd be blamin' at all. Didn't I tell the foreman the man wuz dyin'?
      An' niver a breath did I draw fer the last twinty miles, an' up an' down
      the hills like the divil wuz afther me wid a poker.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you no doctor up there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Docthor, is it? If that's what ye call him, fer the drunken baste that he
      is, wallowin' 'round like Micky Murphy's pig, axin' pardon av the pig.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are there any more sick?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sick? Bedad, they're all sick wid fear, an' half a dozen worse than poor
      Scotty there, God rest his sowl!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor thought a minute, then turning to Shorty he said, speaking
      rapidly, &ldquo;Go and bring to this room the foreman and Swipey. And say not a
      word to anyone, mind that. And you,&rdquo; he said, turning to Tommy, &ldquo;can you
      start back in an hour?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can that same, if I must.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know the road. We'll get another team and start within an hour. Get
      something to eat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a short time both the foreman and the saloon-keeper were in the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This man,&rdquo; said the doctor, &ldquo;is dead. Diphtheria. There is no fear,
      Swipey. Shut that door. But you must have him buried at once, and you will
      both see the necessity of having it done quietly. I shall fumigate this
      room. All this clothing must be burned and there will be no further
      danger. You will see about this to-morrow. I am going up to No. 2
      to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-night, doctor!&rdquo; cried the foreman. &ldquo;It's blowing a regular blizzard.
      Can't you wait till morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are men sick at No. 2,&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;The chances are it's
      diphtheria.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In an hour's time Tommy was at the door with the best team the camp
      possessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you had something to eat, Tommy?&rdquo; inquired the doctor, stepping out
      from the saloon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's what I have,&rdquo; replied Tommy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, then. Give me the lines. You can have a sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not if I know it, begob!&rdquo; said Tommy. &ldquo;I'll stay wid yez. It's mesilf
      that knows a man whin I see him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And off into the blizzard and the night they sped, the doctor rejoicing to
      find in the call to a fight with death that excitement without which it
      seemed he could not live.

    <h3>
      THE FIGHT WITH DEATH
    </h3>
    <p>
      At Camp No. 2 Maclennan had struck what was called a hard proposition. The
      line ran straight through a muskeg out of which the bottom seemed to have
      dropped, and Maclennan himself, with his foreman, Craigin, was almost in
      despair. For every day they were held back by the muskeg meant a serious
      reduction in the profits of Maclennan's contract.
    </p>
    <p>
      The foreman, Craigin, was a man from &ldquo;across the line,&rdquo; skilled in
      railroad building, selected chiefly because of his reputation as a
      &ldquo;driver.&rdquo; He was a man of great physical force and indomitable will, and
      gifted in large measure with the power of command. He knew his business
      thoroughly and knew just how to get the most out of the machinery and men
      at his command. He himself was an untiring worker, and no man on the line
      could get a bigger day out of his force than could Craigin. His men he
      treated as part of his equipment. He believed in what was called his
      &ldquo;scrap-heap policy.&rdquo; When any part of the machinery ceased to do
      first-class work it was at once discarded, and, as with the machinery, so
      it was with the men. A sick man was a nuisance in the camp and must be got
      rid of with all possible speed. Craigin had little faith in human nature,
      and when a man fell ill his first impulse was to suspect him of
      malingering, and hence the standing order of the camp in regard to a sick
      man was that he should get to work or be sent out of the camp. Hence the
      men thoroughly hated their foreman, but as thoroughly they dreaded to fall
      under his displeasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The camp stood in the midst of a swamp, thick with underbrush of spruce
      and balsam and tamarack. The site had been selected after a month of dry
      weather in the fall, consequently the real condition of the ground was not
      discovered until the late rains had swollen the streams from the
      mountain-sides and filled up the intervening valleys and swamps. After the
      frost had fallen the situation was vastly improved, but they all waited
      the warm weather of spring with anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the crest of the hill which overlooked the camp the doctor halted the
      team.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are your stables, Tommy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Over there beyant, forninst the cook-house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Lord!&rdquo; murmured the doctor. &ldquo;How many men have you here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Between two an' three hundred, wid them that are travellin' the road.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are your sanitary arrangements?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean how do you&mdash;what are your arrangements for keeping the camp
      clean, free from dirt and smells? You can't have three hundred men living
      together without some sanitary arrangements.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Begob, it's ivery man fer himsilf. Clane yersilf as ye can through the
      week, an' on Sundays boil yer clothes in soap suds, if ye kin git near the
      kittles. But, bedad, it's the lively time we have wid the crathurs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And is that the bunk-house close up to the cookery?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is that same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why was it built so close as that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure there wuz no ground left by raison av the muskeg at the back av it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor gave it up. &ldquo;Drive on,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But what a beautiful spot for
      a camp right there on that level.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beautiful, is it? Faith, it's not beautiful that Craigin calls it, fer
      ivery thaw the bottom goes clane out av it till ye can't git round fer mud
      an' the dump fallin' through to the antipods,&rdquo; replied Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but up on this flat here, Tommy, under the big pines, that would be
      a fine spot for the camp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wud that same. Bad luck to the man who set it where it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As they drove into the camp the cook came out with some refuse which he
      dumped down on a heap at the door. The doctor shuddered as he thought of
      that heap when the sun shone upon it in the mild weather. A huge Swede
      followed the cook out with a large red muffler wrapped round his throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Yonie!&rdquo; cried Tommy. &ldquo;What's afther gittin' ye up so early?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is no sleep for dis,&rdquo; cried Yonie thickly, pointing to his throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor sprang from the sleigh. &ldquo;Let me look at your throat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's the docthor, Yonie,&rdquo; explained Tommy, whereupon the Swede submitted
      to the examination.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor turned him toward the east, where the sun was just peeping
      through the treetops, and looked into his throat. &ldquo;My man, you go right
      back to bed quick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it will not to bed,&rdquo; replied Yonie. &ldquo;Big work to-day, boss say. He
      not like men sick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You hear me,&rdquo; said the doctor sharply. &ldquo;You go back to bed. Where's your
      doctor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He slapes in the office between meals. Yonder,&rdquo; said Tommy, pointing the
      way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind now. Where are your sick men?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;De seeck mans?&rdquo; replied the cook. &ldquo;She's be hall overe. On de bunk-house,
      on de cook shed. Dat is imposseeb to mak' de cook for den seeck mans hall
      aroun'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? Do they sit around where you are cooking?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainment. Dat's warm plas. De bunkhouse she's col.' Poor feller! But
      she's mak' me beeg troub'. She's cough, cough, speet, speet. Bah! dat's
      what you call lak' one beas'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor strode into the cook-house. By the light of the lantern
      swinging from the roof he found three men huddled over the range, the
      picture of utter misery. He took down the lantern.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, cook, hold this please, one moment. Allow me to look at your
      throats, men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dis de docteur, men,&rdquo; said the cook.
    </p>
    <p>
      A quick glance he gave at each throat, his face growing more stern with
      each examination.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boys, you must all get to bed at once. You must keep away from this
      cook-house or you'll poison the whole camp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where can we go, doctor? The bunk-house would freeze you and the stink of
      it would make a well man sick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And is there no place else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Unless it's the stables,&rdquo; said another man; &ldquo;they're not quite so
      bad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sit here just now. We'll see about it. But first let me give you
      something.&rdquo; He opened his bag, took out his syringe. &ldquo;Here, Yonie, we'll
      begin with you. Roll up your sleeve.&rdquo; And in three minutes he had given
      all four an antitoxin injection. &ldquo;Now, we'll see the doctor. By the way
      what's his name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hain,&rdquo; said the cook, &ldquo;dat's his nem.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haines,&rdquo; explained one of the men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dat's what I say,&rdquo; said the cook indignantly, &ldquo;Hain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor passed out, went toward the office, knocked at the door, and,
      getting no response, opened it and walked in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be the powers, Narcisse!&rdquo; cried Tommy, as the cook stood looking after
      the doctor, &ldquo;it's little I iver thought I'd pity that baste, but Hivin
      save him now! He'll be thinkin' the divil's come fer him. An' begob, he'll
      be wishin' it wuz before he's through wid him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Dr. Bailey was careful to observe all the rules that the punctilious
      etiquette of the profession demanded. He found Dr. Haines sleeping heavily
      in his clothes. He had had a bad night. He was uneasy at the outbreak of
      sickness in his camp, and more especially was he seized with an anxious
      foreboding in regard to the sick man who had been sent out the day before.
      Besides this, the foreman had cursed him for a drunken fool in the
      presence of the whole camp with such vigour and directness that he had
      found it necessary to sooth his ruffled feelings with large and frequent
      doses of stimulant brought into the camp for strictly medical purposes.
      With difficulty he was roused from his slumber. When fully awake he was
      aware of a young man with a very pale and very stern face standing over
      him. Without preliminary Dr. Bailey began:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dr. Haines, you have some very sick men in this camp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who the deuce are you?&rdquo; replied Haines, staring up at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They call me Dr. Bailey. I have come in from along the line.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dr. Bailey?&rdquo; said Haines, sitting up. &ldquo;Oh, I've heard of you.&rdquo; His tone
      indicated a report none too favourable. In fact, it was his special chum
      and confrere who had been ejected from his position in the Gap camp
      through Dr. Bailey's vigorous measures.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have some very sick men in the camp,&rdquo; repeated Dr. Bailey, his voice
      sharp and stern.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, a little tonsilitis,&rdquo; replied Haines in an indifferent tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Diphtheria,&rdquo; said Bailey shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Diphtheria be hanged!&rdquo; replied Haines insolently; &ldquo;I examined them
      carefully last night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have diphtheria this morning. I have just taken the liberty of
      looking into their throats.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The deuce you have! I like your impudence! Who sent you in here to
      interfere with my practice, young man? Where did you get your professional
      manners?&rdquo; Dr. Haines was the older man and resented the intrusion of this
      smooth-faced young stranger, who added to the crime of his youth that of
      being guilty of a serious breach of professional etiquette.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ought to apologize for looking at your patients,&rdquo; said Dr. Bailey. &ldquo;I
      came in thinking I might be of some assistance in dealing with this
      outbreak of diphtheria, and I was naturally anxious to see&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Diphtheria!&rdquo; blurted Haines. &ldquo;Nothing of the sort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dr. Haines, the man you sent out last night had it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;HAD it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He died an hour after arriving at No. 1.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dead? Cursed fool! He WOULD go against my will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Against your will? Would you let a man in the last stages of diphtheria
      leave this camp against your will with the company's team?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I knew he shouldn't go. But he wanted to go himself, and the
      foreman would have him out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are at least four men going about the camp&mdash;they are now in
      the cook-house where the breakfast is being prepared&mdash;who are
      suffering from a severe attack of diphtheria.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you propose? What can I do in this cursed hole?&rdquo; said Dr. Haines
      petulantly. &ldquo;No appliances, no means of isolation, no nurses, nothing.
      Beside, I have half a dozen camps to look after. What can I do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you ask me?&rdquo; The scorn in the voice was only too apparent. &ldquo;Isolate
      the infected at least.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Haines swore deeply to himself while, with trembling hand, he poured out a
      cupful of whiskey from a bottle standing on a convenient shelf. &ldquo;Isolate?
      How can I isolate? There's no building in which&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make one? Young man, do you know what you are talking about? Do you know
      where you are? Do you know who is running this camp?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. But I do know that these men must be isolated within an hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible! I tell you it is impossible!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dr. Haines, an inquest upon the man sent out from this camp last night
      would result in the verdict of manslaughter. There was no inquest. There
      will be on the next man that dies if there is any neglect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The seriousness of the situation began to dawn upon Haines. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he
      said, &ldquo;if you think you can isolate them, go ahead. I'll see the foreman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every minute is precious. I gave those four men antitoxin. Are there
      others?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't know,&rdquo; Haines growled, as with an oath he went out, followed by Dr.
      Bailey. Just outside the door they met the foreman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is Dr. Bailey, Mr. Craigin.&rdquo; Craigin growled out a salutation. &ldquo;Dr.
      Bailey here says these sick men have diphtheria.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How does he know?&rdquo; inquired Craigin shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has examined them this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you don't know they have diphtheria?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Haines weakly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These men have diphtheria, Mr. Craigin, without a doubt, and they ought
      to be isolated at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isolated? How?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A separate camp must be built and someone appointed to attend them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A separate camp!&rdquo; exclaimed Craigin; &ldquo;I'll see them blanked first! Look
      here, Haines, let's have no nonsense about this. I'm three weeks, yes, a
      month, behind with this job here. This blank, blank muskeg is knocking the
      whole contract endways. We can't spare a single man half a day. And more
      than that, you go talking diphtheria in this camp and you can't hold the
      men here an hour. It's all I can do to hold them as it is.&rdquo; And Craigin
      went off into an elaborate course of profanity descriptive of the various
      characteristics of the men in his employ.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what is to be done?&rdquo; asked Haines helplessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Send 'em out to the steel. They're better in the hospital, anyway. It's
      fine to-day. We'll send every man Jack out to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These men can't be moved,&rdquo; said Dr. Bailey in a quiet voice. &ldquo;You sent a
      man out yesterday and he's dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was bound to go himself. We didn't send him. Anyway, it's none of YOUR
      business. Look here, Haines, you know me. I'm not going to have any of
      this blank nonsense of isolation hospitals and all that blankety blank
      rot. Dose 'em up good and send 'em out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Haines stood silent, too evidently afraid of the foreman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Craigin, it would be murder,&rdquo; said Dr. Bailey, &ldquo;sure murder. Some of
      them might get through. Some would be sure to die. The consequences to
      those responsible&mdash;to Dr. Haines, for instance&mdash;would be
      serious. I am quite sure he will never give orders that these men should
      be moved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He won't, eh? You just wait till you see him do it. Haines will give the
      orders right enough.&rdquo; Craigin's laugh was like the growl of a bear.
      &ldquo;There's a reason, ain't there, Haines? Now you hear me. Those men are
      going out to-day, and so are you, you blank, blank interferin' skunk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Bailey smiled sweetly at Craigin. &ldquo;You may call me what you please
      just now, Mr. Craigin. Before the day is over you won't have enough names
      left. For I tell you that these men suffering from diphtheria are going to
      stay here, and are going to be properly cared for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Craigin was white. That this young pale-faced stranger should presume to
      come into his domain, where his word was wont to run as absolute law,
      filled him with rage unspeakable. But there were serious issues at stake,
      and with a supreme effort he controlled the passionate longing to spring
      upon this upstart and throttle him. He turned sharply to Haines.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dr. Haines, you think these men can go out to-day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Haines hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You understand me, Haines; these men go out or&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Haines was evidently in some horrible dread of the foreman. A moment more
      he paused and then surrendered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, hang it, Bailey, I don't think they're so terribly ill. I guess they
      can go out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dr. Haines,&rdquo; said Craigin, &ldquo;is that your decision?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I think so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Craigin, with a triumphant sneer. He turned to Tommy,
      who was standing near with half a dozen men who had just come out from
      breakfast. &ldquo;Here you, Tommy, get a couple of teams ready and all the
      buffalo robes you need and be ready to start in an hour. Do you hear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do,&rdquo; said Tommy, turning slowly away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tommy,&rdquo; called Dr. Bailey in a sharp, clear tone, &ldquo;you took a man out
      from this camp yesterday. Tell the men here what happened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure, they all know it,&rdquo; said Tommy, who had already told the story of
      poor Scotty's death and of the doctor's efforts to save him. &ldquo;An' it's a
      fine bhoy he wuz, poor Scotty, an' niver a groan out av him all the way
      down, an' not able to swally a taste whin I gave it to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Craigin sprang toward Tommy in a fury. &ldquo;Here you blank, blank, blank! Do
      what I tell you! And the rest of you men, what are you gawkin' at here?
      Get to work!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The men gave back, and some began to move away. Dr. Bailey walked quickly
      past Craigin into the midst of the group.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Men, I want to say something to you.&rdquo; His voice commanded their instant
      attention. &ldquo;There are half a dozen of your comrades in this camp sick with
      diphtheria. I came up here to help. They ought to be isolated to prevent
      the spread of the disease, and they ought to be cared for at once. The
      foreman proposes to send them out. One went out yesterday. He died last
      night. If these men go out to-day some of them will die, and it will be
      murder. What do you say? Will you let them go?&rdquo; A wrathful murmur ran
      through the crowd, which was being rapidly increased every moment by
      others coming from breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get to your work, you fellows, or get your time!&rdquo; shouted Craigin,
      pouring out oaths. &ldquo;And you,&rdquo; turning toward Dr. Bailey, &ldquo;get out of this
      camp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am here in consultation with Dr. Haines,&rdquo; replied Dr. Bailey. &ldquo;He has
      asked my advice, and I am giving it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Send him out, Haines. And be quick about it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By this time the men were fully roused. One of them came forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you propose should be done, Doctor?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going to work, McLean?&rdquo; shouted Craigin furiously. &ldquo;If not, go
      and get your time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We're going to talk this matter over a minute, Mr. Craigin,&rdquo; said McLean
      quietly. &ldquo;It's a serious matter. We are all concerned in it, and we'll
      decide in a few minutes what is to be done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every man who is not at work in five minutes will get his time,&rdquo; said
      Craigin, and he turned away and passed into the office.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you propose should be done, Doctor?&rdquo; said McLean, ignoring the
      foreman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Build a camp where the sick men can be placed by themselves and where
      they can be kept from infecting the rest of the camp. Half a day's work of
      a dozen men will do it. If we send them out some of them will die.
      Besides, it is almost certain that some more of you have already been
      infected.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At once eager discussion began. Some, in dread terror of the disease, were
      for sending out the sick immediately, but the majority would not listen to
      this inhuman proposal. Finally McLean came again to Dr. Bailey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The men want to know if you can guarantee that the disease can be stamped
      out here if you have a separate camp for an hospital?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can guarantee nothing,&rdquo; replied Dr. Bailey. &ldquo;But it is altogether the
      safer way to fight the disease. And I am of the opinion that we can stamp
      it out.&rdquo; The doctor's air and tone of quiet confidence, far more than his
      words, decided the men's action. In a minute more it was agreed that the
      sick men should stay and that they would all stand together in carrying
      out the plan of isolation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he gives any of us time,&rdquo; said Tommy, &ldquo;we'll all take it, begob.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, men,&rdquo; said the doctor, &ldquo;let's not make trouble. I know Mr. Maclennan
      slightly, and he's a just man, and he'll do what's fair. Besides, we don't
      want to interfere with the job. Give me a dozen men&mdash;one must be able
      to cook&mdash;and in half a day the work will be finished. I will be
      personally responsible for everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this point Craigin came out. &ldquo;Here's your time, McLean,&rdquo; he said,
      thrusting a time check at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      McLean took it without a word and went over and stood by Dr. Bailey's
      side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are coming?&rdquo; called out McLean.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All of us,&rdquo; cried a voice. &ldquo;Pick out your men, McLean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said McLean, looking over the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm wan,&rdquo; said Tommy, running over to the doctor's side. &ldquo;I seen him
      shtand by Scotty whin the lad wus fightin' fer his life, an' if I'm tuk
      it's him I want beside me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One by one McLean called his men, each taking his place beside the doctor,
      while the rest of the men moved off to work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Craigin, I am going to use these men for half a day.&rdquo; said Dr.
      Bailey.
    </p>
    <p>
      For answer Craigin, in mad rage, throwing aside all regard for
      consequences, rushed at him, but half a dozen men were in his path before
      he had taken the second step.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold on, Mr. Craigin,&rdquo; said McLean, &ldquo;we want no violence. We're going to
      do what we think right in this matter, so you may as well make up your
      mind to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Mr. Craigin,&rdquo; continued the doctor, &ldquo;we shall need some things out of
      your stores.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Craigin stepped back from the crowd and on to the office steps. &ldquo;Your time
      is waiting you, men. And listen to me. If any man goes near that there
      storehouse door, I'll drop him in his tracks. I've got the law and I'll do
      it, so help me God.&rdquo; He went into the office and returned in a moment with
      a Winchester, which he loaded in full view of the men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind him, boys,&rdquo; said the doctor cheerily, &ldquo;I'm going to have
      breakfast. Come, Tommy, I want you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In fifteen minutes he came out, with the key of the storehouse in his
      hand, to find the men still waiting his orders and Craigin on guard with
      his Winchester.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't go just yet,&rdquo; said McLean to the doctor in a low voice, &ldquo;we'll get
      round him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he'll not shoot,&rdquo; said Dr. Bailey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will. He will. I knew him in Michigan. He'll shoot and he'll kill,
      too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a single instant the doctor hesitated. His men were about him waiting
      his lead. Craigin with his rifle held them all in check. A moment's
      thought and his decision was taken. He stepped toward Craigin and said in
      a clear voice, &ldquo;Mr. Craigin, these stores are necessary to save these
      men's lives. I want them and I'm going to take them. Murder me, if you
      like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hear me, men.&rdquo; Craigin's voice was cold and deliberate. &ldquo;These stores are
      in my charge. I am an officer of the law. If any man lays his hand on that
      latch I'll shoot him, so help me God.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hear me, Mr. Craigin,&rdquo; replied Dr. Bailey. &ldquo;I'm here in consultation with
      Dr. Haines, who has turned over this matter to my charge. In a case of
      this kind the doctor's orders are supreme. This whole camp is under his
      authority. These stores are necessary, and I am going to get them.&rdquo; He
      well knew the weak spot in his position, but he counted on Craigin's nerve
      breaking down. In that, however, he was mistaken. Without haste, but
      without hesitation, he walked toward the storehouse door. When three paces
      from it Craigin's voice arrested him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold on there! Put your hand on that door and, as God lives, you're a
      dead man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without a word the doctor turned again toward the door. The men with
      varying cries rushed toward the foreman. Craigin threw up his rifle.
      Immediately a shot rang out and Craigin fell to the snow, the smoking
      rifle dropping from his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Begob, I niver played baseball,&rdquo; cried Tommy, rushing in and seizing the
      rifle, &ldquo;but many's the time I've had the divarsion in the streets av
      Dublin of bringin' down the polismen wid a brick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A heavy horseshoe, heaved with sure aim, had saved the doctor's life. They
      carried Craigin into the office and laid him on the bed, the blood
      streaming from a ghastly wound in his scalp. Quickly Dr. Bailey got to
      work and before Craigin had regained consciousness the wound was sewed up
      and dressed. Then giving him over to the charge of Haines, Dr. Bailey went
      about the work he had in hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the noon hour had arrived the eight men who were discovered to be
      in various stages of diphtheria were comfortably housed in a roomy
      building rudely constructed of logs, tar paper, and tarpaulin, with a
      small cook-house attached and Tommy Tate in charge. And before night had
      fallen the process of disinfecting the bedding, clothing, bunk-house, and
      cookery was well under way, while all who had been in immediate contact
      with the infected men had been treated by the doctor with antitoxin as a
      precautionary measure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the first day's campaign against death closed with the issue still
      undecided, but the chances for winning were certainly greater than they
      had been. What the result would be when Craigin was able to take command
      again, no one could say. But in the meantime, for the next two days, the
      work on the dump was prosecuted with all vigour, the men feeling in honour
      bound to support the doctor in that part of the fight which fell to them.

    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE MEDICAL SUPERINTENDENT OF THE CROW'S NEST
    </h3>
    <p>
      Mr. Maclennan was evidently worried. His broad, good-humoured face, which
      usually wore a smile indicating content with the world and especially with
      himself, was drawn into a frown. The muskeg was beating him, and he hated
      to be beaten. He was bringing in General Manager Fahey to have a look at
      things. It was important to awaken the sympathy of the General Manager,
      if, indeed, this could be accomplished. But the General Manager had a way
      of insisting upon his contracts being fulfilled, and this stretch in
      Maclennan's charge was the one spot which the General Manager feared would
      occasion delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's the hole,&rdquo; said Maclennan, as they turned down the hill into the
      swamp. &ldquo;Into that hole,&rdquo; he continued, pointing to where the dump ended
      abruptly in the swamp, &ldquo;I can't tell you how many millions of carloads
      have been dumped. I used to brag that I was never beaten in my life, but
      that hole&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maclennan, that hole has got to be filled up, bridged, or trestled, and
      we can't wait too long, either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The General Manager's name was a synonym for a relentless sort of energy
      in railroad construction that refused to consider obstacles. Nothing could
      stand in his way. The thing behind which he put the weight of his
      determination simply had to move in one direction or other. The contractor
      that failed expected no mercy, and received none.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We're doing our best,&rdquo; said Maclennan, &ldquo;and we will continue to do our
      best. Hello! what's this? What's Craigin doing up here? Hold up, Sandy.
      We'll look in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the door of the hospital Dr. Haines met him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Doctor! What have you got here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isolation hospital,&rdquo; replied the doctor shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What hospital?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isolation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has Craigin gone mad all at once?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Craigin has nothing to do with it. There's a new boss in camp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A look of wrathful amazement crossed Maclennan's countenance. Haines was
      beginning to enjoy himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A new boss? What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I say. A young fellow calling himself Dr. Bailey came into this camp
      three days ago, raised the biggest kind of a row, laid up Craigin with a
      broken head, and took charge of the camp.&rdquo; Maclennan stood in amazement
      looking from Haines to the General Manager.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dr. Bailey? You mean Bailey from No. 1? What has he got to do with it?
      And how did Craigin come to allow him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask Craigin,&rdquo; replied Haines.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you got in there, Doctor?&rdquo; asked Mr. Fahey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Diphtheria patients.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How many?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we began with eight three days ago and we've ten to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, this knocks me out,&rdquo; said Maclennan. &ldquo;Where's Craigin, anyway?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's down in his own room in bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Maclennan turned and got into the sleigh. &ldquo;Come on, Fahey,&rdquo; he said,
      &ldquo;let's go down. Something extraordinary has happened. You can't believe
      that fellow Haines. What are you laughing at?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fahey was too much of an Irishman to miss seeing the humour of any
      situation. &ldquo;I can't help it, Maclennan. I'll bet you a box of cigars that
      man Bailey is an Irishman. He must be a whirlwind. But it's no laughing
      matter,&rdquo; continued the General Manager, sobering up. &ldquo;This has a very
      serious aspect. There are a whole lot of men sick in our camps. You
      contractors don't pay enough attention to your health.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Health! When you're driving us like all possessed there's no time to
      think of health.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you, Maclennan, it's bad policy. You have got to think of health.
      The newspapers are beginning to talk. Why, look at that string of men you
      met going out. Of course, the great majority of them never should have
      come in. Hundreds of men are here who never used either shovel or axe.
      They cut themselves, get cold, rheumatism, or something; they're not fit
      for their work. All the same, we get blamed. But my theory is that every
      camp should have an hospital, with three main hospitals along this branch.
      There's one at Macleod. It is filled, overflowing. A young missionary
      fellow, Boyle, has got one running out at Kuskinook supported by some
      Toronto ladies. It's doing fine work, too; but it's overflowing. There's a
      young lady in charge there, a Miss Robertson, and she's a daisy. The
      trouble there is you can't get the fellows to leave, and I don't blame
      them. If ever I get sick send me to her. I tell you, Maclennan, if we had
      two or three first-class men, with three main hospitals, a branch in every
      camp, we'd keep the health department in first-class condition. The men
      would stay with us. We'd get altogether better results.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's all right,&rdquo; said Maclennan, &ldquo;but where are you to get your
      first-class men? They come to us with letters from Directors or some big
      bug or other. You've got to appoint them. Look at that man Haines. He
      doesn't know his work and he's drunk half the time. Dr. Bailey seems to be
      different. He certainly knows his work and he never touches whiskey. I got
      him up from the Gap to No. 1. In two weeks' time he had things in great
      shape. Funny thing, too, when he's fighting some sickness or busy he's all
      right, but when things get quiet he hits the green table hard. He's a
      wonder at poker, they say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The General Manager pricked up his ears. &ldquo;Poker, eh? I'll remember that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this here business is going too far,&rdquo; continued Maclennan. &ldquo;I didn't
      hire him to run my camps. Well, we'll see what Craigin has to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As they drove into the camp they were met by Narcisse, the cook.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bo' jour, M'sieu Maclenn'. You want something for hit?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-day, cook,&rdquo; said Maclennan. &ldquo;Yes, we'll take a cup of tea in a few
      minutes. I want to see Mr. Craigin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Narcisse drew near Maclennan and in subdued voice announced, &ldquo;M'sieu
      Craigin, he's not ver' well. He's hurt hisself. He's lie on bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what's the matter with him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Narcisse shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;Oh, some leet' troub'. You pass on de
      office you see de docteur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Haines is up at the hospital. We just saw him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hain!&rdquo; said Narcisse, with scorn indescribable. &ldquo;Dat's no docteur for one
      horse. Bah! De mans go seeck, seeck, he can noting. He know noting. He's
      get on beeg drunk! Non! Nodder docteur. He's come in, fin' tree, four mans
      seeck on de troat, cough, cough, sore, bad. Fill up de cook-house. Can't
      do noting. Sainte Marie! Dat new docteur, he's come on de camp, he's mak'
      one leet' fight, he's beeld hospital an' get dose seeck mans all nice an'
      snug. Bon. Good. By gar, dat's good feller!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The smile broadened on Fahey's face. &ldquo;I say, Maclennan, he's captured your
      camp. He's got the cook, dead sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The smile didn't help Maclennan's temper. He opened the office door and
      passed into Craigin's private room at the back. Here he found Dr. Bailey
      in charge. As he opened the door the doctor put up his hand for silence
      and backed him out into the office.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me, Mr. Maclennan,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;he's asleep and must not be
      disturbed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Maclennan shook hands with him with a cold &ldquo;How are you,&rdquo; and introduced
      him to Mr. Fahey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Mr. Craigin ill?&rdquo; inquired Fahey innocently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has met with a slight accident,&rdquo; replied the doctor. &ldquo;He is doing well
      and will be about in a day or two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Accident?&rdquo; snorted Maclennan; then clearing his throat as for a speech he
      began in a loud tone, &ldquo;Dr. Bailey, I must say&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; said the doctor, opening the office door and marshalling them
      outside, &ldquo;we'd better go somewhere else if we are going to talk. It is
      important that my patient should be kept perfectly quiet.&rdquo; The doctor's
      air was so entirely respectful and at the same time so masterful that
      Maclennan found himself walking meekly toward the grub-house behind the
      doctor, with Fahey, the smile on his face broader than ever, bringing up
      the rear. Maclennan caught the smile, but in the face of the doctor's
      quiet, respectful manner he found it difficult to rouse himself to wrath.
      He took refuge in bluster.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my word, Dr. Bailey,&rdquo; he burst forth when once they were inside the
      grub-house, &ldquo;it seems to me that you have carried things on with a high
      hand in this camp. You come in here, a perfect stranger, you head a
      mutiny, you lay up my foreman with a dangerous wound, with absolutely no
      authority from anyone. What in the blank, blank do you mean, anyway?&rdquo;
       Maclennan was rather pleased to find himself at length taking fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Maclennan,&rdquo; said the doctor quietly, &ldquo;it is natural you should be
      angry. Let me give you the facts before you pass your final judgment. A
      man was sent to me from this camp in a dying condition. Diphtheria. I
      learned there were others suffering here with the same disease. I came in
      at once to offer assistance. Consulted with Dr. Haines. We came to a
      practical agreement as to what ought to be done. Mr. Craigin objected.
      There was some trouble. Unfortunately, Mr. Craigin was hurt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dr. Bailey,&rdquo; said the General Manager, &ldquo;it will save trouble if you will
      go somewhat fully into the facts. We want an exact statement of what
      occurred.&rdquo; The authoritative tone drew Dr. Bailey's attention to the
      rugged face of the speaker, with its square forehead and bull-dog jaw. He
      recognized at once that he had to deal with a man of more than ordinary
      force, and he proceeded to give him an exact statement of all that had
      happened, beginning with the death of Scotty Anderson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is all, gentlemen,&rdquo; said the doctor, as he concluded his tale; &ldquo;I
      did what I considered was right. Prompt action was necessary. I may have
      been mistaken, but I think not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mistaken!&rdquo; cried Fahey, with a great oath. &ldquo;I tell you, Maclennan, we've
      had a close shave. We may, perhaps, explain that one man's death, but if
      six or eight men had gone out of this camp in the condition in which the
      doctor says they were, the results would have been not only deplorable as
      far as the men are concerned, but disastrous to us with the public. Why,
      good heavens above! what a shave it was! Dr. Bailey, I am proud to meet
      you,&rdquo; continued Fahey, putting out his hand. &ldquo;You had a most difficult
      situation to deal with and you handled it like a general.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I quite agree with you,&rdquo; said Maclennan, shaking Dr. Bailey warmly by the
      hand. &ldquo;The measures were somewhat drastic, but something had to be done.
      Go right on, Doctor. When Craigin is on his feet again we'll send him
      out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Craigin will be quite fit to work in a day or so. But I would suggest
      that he keep his place. You can't afford to lose a man of his force.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, we'll see, we'll see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dr. Bailey, I'd like to see your hospital arrangements. Mac will be busy
      just now and will excuse us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next two hours the General Manager spent in extracting from Dr. Bailey
      his theories in regard to camp sanitation and the care of the sick.
      Finding a listener at once so sympathetic and so intelligent, Dr. Bailey
      seized the opportunity of expatiating to the fullest extent upon the theme
      which, during the last few months, had been absorbing his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These camps are wrongly constructed in the first instance&mdash;every one
      that I have seen. Almost every law of sanitation is ignored. In location,
      in relative position of buildings, the disposal of refuse, the treatment
      of the sick and injured, the whole business reveals atrocious folly and
      ignorance. For instance, take this camp. The only thing that prevents an
      outbreak of typhoid is the cold weather. In the spring you will have a
      state of things here that will arrest the attention of Canada. Look at the
      location of the camp. Down in a swamp, with a magnificent site five
      hundred yards away,&rdquo; pointing to a little plateau further up the hill,
      clear of underbrush and timbered with great pines. &ldquo;Then look at the
      stables where they are. There are no means by which the men can keep
      themselves or their clothes clean. Their bunks, some of them, are alive
      with vermin, and the bunk-house is reeking with all sorts of smells. At a
      very little more cost you could have had a camp here pleasant, safe,
      clean, and an hospital ready for emergencies. Why, good heavens! they
      might at least have kept the vermin out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, pshaw!&rdquo; said Fahey, &ldquo;every camp has to have a few of them fellows.
      Makes the men feel at home. Besides, you can't absolutely drive them out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drive them out? Give me a free hand and I'll make this camp clean of
      vermin in two weeks, absolutely, and keep it so. Why, it would pay,&rdquo;
       continued the doctor. &ldquo;You would keep your men in good condition, in good
      heart and spirits. They would do twice the work. They would stay with you.
      Besides, it would prevent scandal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Scandal?&rdquo; The General Manager looked up sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, scandal. I have done what I could to prevent talk, but down the line
      they are talking some, and if I am not mistaken it will be all over the
      East in a few weeks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The General Manager was thinking hard. &ldquo;Look here, young man,&rdquo; he said,
      with the air of one who has made up his mind, &ldquo;do you drink?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you gamble?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I've nothing to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; said Mr. Fahey, &ldquo;a little poker doesn't hurt a man now and
      then. I am going to make you an offer which I hope you will consider
      favourably. I offer you the position of medical superintendent of this
      line at a salary of three thousand a year and all expenses. It's not much,
      but if the thing goes we can easily increase it. You needn't answer just
      now. Think it over. I don't know your credentials, but I don't care.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For answer, Dr. Bailey took out his pocketbook and selected a letter. &ldquo;I
      didn't think I would ever use this. I didn't want to use it. But you can
      look at it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fahey took the letter, glanced through it hurriedly, then read it
      again with more care.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know Sir William?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very slightly. Met him once or twice in London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a most unusual letter for him to write. You must have stood very
      high in the profession in London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had a fairly good position,&rdquo; said Dr. Bailey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I ask why you left?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Bailey hesitated. &ldquo;I grew tired of the life&mdash;and, besides&mdash;well&mdash;I
      wanted to get away from things and people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon my asking,&rdquo; said Fahey hastily. &ldquo;It was none of my business. But,
      Doctor&mdash;&rdquo; here he glanced at the letter again, &ldquo;Bailey, you say your
      name is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They called me Bailey when I came in and I let it go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, sir,&rdquo; replied Fahey quickly, &ldquo;Bailey let it be. My offer
      holds, only I'll make it four thousand. We can't expect a man of your
      standing for less.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Fahey, I came here to work on the construction. I wanted to forget.
      When I saw how things were going at the east end I couldn't help jumping
      it. I never thought I should have enjoyed my professional work so much. It
      has kept me busy. I will accept your offer at three thousand, but on the
      distinct understanding that I am to have my way in everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By gad! you'll take it, anyway, I imagine,&rdquo; said Fahey, with a laugh, &ldquo;so
      we may as well put it in the contract. In your department you are supreme.
      If you see anything you want, take it. If you don't see it, we will get it
      for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On their return to the office they found Dr. Haines in Craigin's room with
      Maclennan. As they entered they heard Haines' voice saying, &ldquo;I believe it
      was a put-up job with Tommy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a blank lie!&rdquo; roared Craigin. &ldquo;I have it from Tommy that it was his
      own notion to fire that shoe, and a blank good thing for me it was.
      Otherwise I should have killed the best man that ever walked into this
      camp. Here, keep your hands off! You paw around my head like a blanked
      bull in a sand heap. Where's the doctor? Why ain't he here attending to
      his business?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Craigin,&rdquo; he said quietly, &ldquo;let me look at that. Ah, it's got a twist,
      that's all. There, that's better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Like a child Craigin submitted to his quick, light touch and sank back in
      his pillow with a groan of content. Dr. Bailey gave him his medicine and
      induced him, much against his will, to take some nourishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There now, that's all right. To-morrow you'll be sitting up. Now you must
      be kept quiet.&rdquo; As he said this he motioned them out of the room. As he
      was leaving, Craigin called him back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to see Maclennan,&rdquo; he said gruffly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait till to-morrow, Mr. Craigin,&rdquo; replied the doctor, in soothing tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to see him now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor called Mr. Maclennan back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maclennan, I want to say there's the whitest man in these mountains. I
      was a blank, blank fool. But for him I might have been a murderer two or
      three times over, and, God help me! but for that lucky shoe of Tommy's I'd
      have murdered him. I want to say this to you, and I want the doctor here
      not to lay it up against me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Craigin,&rdquo; said Maclennan, &ldquo;I'm glad to hear you say so. And I
      guess the doctor here won't cherish any grudge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without a word the doctor closed the door upon Maclennan, then went to the
      bedside. &ldquo;Craigin, you are a man. I'd be glad to call you my friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was all. The two men shook hands and the doctor passed out, leaving
      Craigin more at peace with himself and with the world than he had been for
      some days.

    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE LADY OF KUSKINOOK
    </h3>
    <p>
      Soon after Dick's departure for the West, Ben Fallows took up his abode at
      the Old Stone Mill and very soon found himself firmly established as a
      member of the family there; and so it came that he was present on the
      occasion of Margaret's visit, when the offer of the Kuskinook Hospital was
      under consideration. The offer came through the Superintendent, but it was
      due chiefly to the influence on the Toronto Board of Mrs. Macdougall. It
      was to her that Dick had appealed for a matron for the new hospital, which
      had come into existence largely through his efforts and advocacy. &ldquo;We want
      as matron,&rdquo; Dick had written, &ldquo;a strong, sane woman who knows her work,
      and is not afraid to tackle anything. She must be cheery in manner and
      brave in heart, not too old, and the more beautiful she is the better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cheery in manner and brave in heart?&rdquo; Mrs. Macdougall had said to
      herself, looking at the letter. &ldquo;The very one! She is that and she is all
      the rest, and she is not too old, and beautiful enough even for Mr. Dick.&rdquo;
       Here Mrs. Macdougall smiled a gentle smile of deprecation at the
      suggestion that flitted across her mind at that point. &ldquo;No, she'll never
      be old to Dick. We'll send her, and who knows, but&mdash;&rdquo; Not even to
      herself, however, much less to another, did the little lady breathe a word
      of any 'arriere pensee' in urging the appointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the Superintendent's letter in her hand, Margaret had gone to consult
      Barney's mother; for to Margaret Mrs. Boyle was ever &ldquo;Barney's mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be a very fine work,&rdquo; said Mrs. Boyle, &ldquo;but oh, lassie! it is a
      long, long way. And you would be far from all that knew you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Dick is not very far away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye, but I doubt you would see little of him, with all the travelling
      he's doing to those terrible camps. And what if anything should happen to
      you, and no one to care for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old lady's hands trembled over the tea cups. She had aged much during
      the last six years. The sword had pierced her heart with Barney's going
      from home. And while, in the case of her younger and favourite son, she
      had without grudging made the ancient sacrifice, lines of her surrender
      showed deep upon her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter with me goin' along, Miss Margaret?&rdquo; said Ben, breaking
      in upon the pause in the conversation. &ldquo;There's one of the old gang out
      there. We cawn't 'ave Barney, but you'd do in his place, an' I guess we
      could make things hump a bit. W'en the gang gits a goin' things begin to
      hum. You remember that day down at the 'Old King's' w'en me an' Barney an'
      Dick&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Och! Ben lad,&rdquo; said Mrs. Boyle, &ldquo;Margaret will be hearing that story
      many's the time. But what would you be doing in an hospital?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me? I hain't goin' fer to work in no 'ospital! I'm goin' to look after
      Miss Margaret. She wants someone to look after her, don't she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye, that she does,&rdquo; remarked Mrs. Boyle, with such emphasis that
      Margaret flushed as she cried, &ldquo;Not I! My business is to look after other
      people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the more the matter was discussed the clearer it became that
      Margaret's work lay at Kuskinook, and further, that she could not do
      better than take Ben along to &ldquo;look after her,&rdquo; as he put it. Hence,
      before the year had gone, all through the Windermere and Crow's Nest
      valleys the fame of the Lady of Kuskinook grew great, and second only to
      hers was that of her bodyguard, the hospital orderly, Ben Fallows. And
      indeed, Ben's usefulness was freely acknowledged by both staff and
      patients; for by day or by night he was ever ready to skip off on errands
      of mercy, his wooden leg clicking a vigorous tattoo to his rapid
      movements. He was especially proud of that wooden leg, a combination of
      joints and springs so wonderful that he was often heard to lament the
      clumsiness of the other leg in comparison.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;W'en it comes to legs,&rdquo; Ben would say, &ldquo;this 'ere's the machine fer me.
      It never gits rheumatism in the joints, nor corns on the toes, an' yeh
      cawn't freeze it with forty below.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Ben grew in fame so he grew in dignity and in solemn and serious
      appreciation of himself, and of his position in the hospital. The
      institution became to him not simply a thing of personal pride, but an
      object of reverent regard. To Ben's mind, taking it all in all, it stood
      unique among all similar institutions in the Dominion. While, as for the
      matron, as he watched her at her work his wonder grew and, with it, a love
      amounting to worship. In his mind she dwelt apart as something sacred, and
      to serve her and to guard her became a religion with Ben. In fact, the
      Glory of the Kuskinook hospital lay chiefly in this, that it afforded a
      sphere in which his divinity might exercise her various powers and graces.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was just at this point that Tommy Tate roused his wrath. Dr. Bailey's
      foreboding regarding Maclennan's Camp No. 2 had been justified by a
      serious outbreak in early spring of typhoid, of malignant type, to which
      Tommy fell a victim. The hospitals along the line were already
      overflowing, and so the doctor had sent Tommy to Kuskinook in charge of an
      assistant. After a six weeks' doubtful struggle with the disease Tommy
      began to convalesce, and with returning strength revived his invincible
      love of mischief, which he gratified in provoking the soul of Orderly Ben
      Fallows, notwithstanding that the two had become firm friends during the
      tedious course of Tommy's sickness. It didn't take Tommy long to discover
      Ben's tender spots, the most tender of which he found to be the honour of
      the hospital and all things and persons associated therewith. As to the
      matron, Tommy ventured no criticism. He had long since enrolled her among
      his saints, and Ben Fallows himself was not a more enthusiastic devotee
      than he. And not even to gratify his insatiable desire for fun at Ben's
      expense would Tommy venture any liberty with the name of the matron. In
      regard to the young preacher, however, who seemed to be a somewhat
      important part of the institution, Tommy was not so scrupulous, while as
      to the hospital appointments and methods, he never hesitated to champion
      the superior methods of those down the line.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a beautiful May morning and Tommy was signalizing his unusually
      vigorous health by a very specially exasperating criticism of the
      Kuskinook hospital and its belongings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's the beautiful hospitals they are down the line. They don't have the
      frills and tucks on their shirts, to be sure, but they do the thrick, so
      they do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess they're all right fer simple cases,&rdquo; agreed Ben, &ldquo;but w'en yeh
      git somethin' real bad yeh got to come 'ere. Look at yerself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arrah! an' that was the docthor, Hivin be swate to him! He tuk a notion
      t' me fer a good turn I done him wance. Begob, there's a man fer ye! Talk
      about yer white min! Talk about yer prachers an' the like! There's a man
      fer ye, an' there's none to measure wid him in the mountains!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dr. Bailey, I suppose ye're talkin' about?&rdquo; inquired Ben, with fine
      scorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yis, Dr. Bailey, an' that's the first two letters av his name. An' whin
      ye find a man to stand forninst him, by the howly poker! I'll ate him
      alive, an' so I will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I hain't agoin' to say, Mr. Tate,&rdquo; said Ben, with studied,
      politeness, &ldquo;that no doctor can never compare with a preacher, for I've
      seen a doctor myself, an' there's the kind of work he done,&rdquo; displaying
      his wooden leg and foot with pride. &ldquo;But what I say is that w'en it comes
      to doin' real 'igh-class, fine work, give me the Reverend Richard Boyle,
      Esquire. Yes, sir, sez I, Dick Boyle's the man fer me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, gwan now wid ye! An' wud ye be afther puttin' a preacher in the same
      car wid a docthor, an' him the Medical Superintendent av the railway?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hain't talkin' 'bout preachers an' doctors in general,&rdquo; replied Ben,
      keeping himself firmly in hand, &ldquo;but I'm talkin' about this 'ere preacher,
      the Reverend Richard Boyle.&rdquo; Ben's attention to the finer courtesies in
      conversation always increased with his wrath. &ldquo;An' that I'll stick to, for
      there's no man in these 'ere mountain 'as done more fer this 'ere country
      than that same Reverend Richard Boyle, Esquire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen til the monkey! An' what has he done, will ye tell me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Ben, ignoring Tommy's opprobrious epithet, &ldquo;I hain't got a
      day to spend, but, to begin with, there's two churches up the Windermere
      which&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Churches, is it? Sure an' what is a church good fer but to bury a man
      from, forby givin' the women a place to say their prayers an' show their
      hats?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I was sayin',&rdquo; continued Ben, &ldquo;there's two churches up the Windermere.
      I hain't no saint, an' I hain't no scholar, but I goes by them as is, an'
      I know that there's Miss Margaret, an' I tell you&rdquo;&mdash;here Ben solemnly
      removed his pipe from his mouth and, holding it by the bowl, pointed the
      stem, by way of emphasizing his words, straight at Tommy's face&mdash;&ldquo;I
      tell you she puts them churches above even this 'ere hinstitution!&rdquo; And
      Ben sat back in his chair to allow the full magnitude of this fact to have
      its full weight with Tommy. For once Tommy was without reply, for anything
      savouring of criticism of Miss Margaret or her opinions was impossible to
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' what's more,&rdquo; continued Ben, &ldquo;this 'ere hinstitution in which we're
      a-sittin' this hour wouldn't be 'ere but fer that same preacher an' them
      that backs him up. That's yer churches fer yeh!&rdquo; And still Tommy remained
      silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' if yeh want to knew more about him, you ask Magee there, an' Morrison
      an' Old Cap Jim an' a 'eap of fellows about this 'ere preacher, an' 'ear
      'em talk. Don't ask me. 'Ear 'em talk w'en they git time. They wuz a
      blawsted lot of drunken fools, workin' for the whiskey-sellers an' the
      tin-horn gamblers. Now they're straight an' sendin' their money 'ome. An'
      there's some as I know would be a lot better if they done the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Manin' mesilf, ye blaggard! An' tis thrue fer ye. But luk at the docthor,
      will ye, ain't he down on the whiskey, too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that's w'at I 'ear,&rdquo; conceded Ben. &ldquo;But e'll soak 'em good at
      poker.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bedad, it's the truth ye're spakin,&rdquo; said Tommy enthusiastically. &ldquo;An' it
      wud do ye more good than a month's masses to see him take the hair aff the
      tin horns, the divil fly away wid thim! An' luk at the 'rid lights'&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Red lights'?&rdquo; interrupted Ben. &ldquo;Now ye're talkin'. Who cleared up the
      'rid lights' at Bull Crossin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who did, thin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who? The Reverend Richard Boyle is the man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, run in an' shut the dure! Ye're walkin' in yer slape.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Tate, I 'appen to know the facts in this 'ere particular case,
      beggin' yer 'umble pardon.&rdquo; Ben's h's became more lubricous with his
      rising indignation. &ldquo;An' I 'appen to know that agin the Pioneer's violent
      opposition, agin the business men, agin his own helder a-keepin' the drug
      shop, agin the hagent of the town site an' agin the whole blawsted,
      bloomin' population, that 'ere preacher put up a fight, by the jumpin'
      Jemima! that made 'em all 'unt their 'oles!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, Benny, it's wanderin' agin ye are! Did ye niver hear how the docthor
      walked intil the big meetin' an' in five minutes made the iditor av the
      Pioneer an' the town site agent an' that bunch look like last year's
      potaty patch fer ould shaws, wid the spache he gave thim?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Ben, &ldquo;I didn't 'ear any such thing, I didn't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, thin, go out into society, me bhoy, an' kape yer ears clane.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My ears don't require no such cleanin' as some I know!&rdquo; cried Ben, whose
      self-control was strained to the point of breaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Manin' mesilf agin. Begorra, it's yer game leg that saves ye from a
      batin'!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't fight no sick man in our own 'ospital,&rdquo; replied Ben scornfully,
      &ldquo;but w'en yer sufficiently recovered, I'd be proud to haccommodate yeh.
      But as fer this 'ere preacher&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, go on wid yer preacher an' yer hull outfit! The docthor yonder's
      worth&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Mr. Tate, this 'ere's goin' past the limit. I can put up with a good
      deal of abuse from a sick man, but w'en I 'ears any reflections thrown out
      at this 'ere 'ospital an' them as runs it, by the livin' jumpin' Jemima
      Jebbs! I hain't goin' to stand it, not me!&rdquo; Ben's voice rose in a shrill
      cry of anger. &ldquo;I'd 'ave yeh to know that the 'ead of this 'ere
      hinstitution&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, whist now, ye blatherin' bletherskite, who's talkin' about the Head?
      The Head, is it? An' d'ye think I'd sthand&mdash;Howly Moses! here she
      comes, an' the angels thimsilves wud luk like last year beside her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-morning, Tommy. Why, I do think you are looking remarkably well
      to-day,&rdquo; cried the matron, her brisk step, bright face, and cheery voice
      eloquent of her splendid vitality and high spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Och! thin, an' who wudn't luk well in your prisince?&rdquo; said the gallant
      little Irishman, with a touch to his hat. &ldquo;Sure, it's better than the
      sunlight to see the smile av yer pritty face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Tommy, Tommy, we'll have to be sending you away if you go on like
      that. It's a sure sign of convalescence when an Irishman begins to
      blarney.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blarney, indade! Bedad, it's God's mercy I don't have to blarney, for I
      haven't the strength to do that same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Tommy, don't try. Keep your strength for getting well again. Ben, I
      think I saw Mr. Boyle riding up. Will you please go and take his horse and
      show him up to the office. I am just wanting his help in preparing my
      annual report.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Report!&rdquo; cried Ben. &ldquo;A day like this! No, sez I; git out into the woods
      an' git a little colour into yer cheeks. It'll do him good, too. This' ere
      hinstitution is takin' the life out o' yeh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Ben went away grumbling his discontent and wrath at the matron's
      inability to take thought for herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tiny office was bare enough of beauty, but from the window there
      stretched a scene glorious in its majestic sweep and in its varied
      loveliness. Down over the tops of second-growth jack pine and Douglas fir
      one looked straight into the roaring gorge of the Goat River filled with
      misty light and overhung with an arching rainbow. Up the other side
      climbed the hills in soft folds of pine tops and, beyond the pines, to the
      sheer, grey, rocky peaks in whose clefts and crags the snow lay like
      fretted silver. Far up the valley to the east the line of the new railway
      gleamed here and there through the pines, while to the west the Goat River
      gorge issued into the splendid expanse of the Kootenay Valley, forest-clad
      and lying now in all the sunlit glory of its new spring dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some moments Dick stood gazing. &ldquo;Of all views I see, this is the
      best,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Day or night I can get it clear as I see it now, and it
      always brings me rest and comfort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rest and comfort?&rdquo; echoed Margaret, coming to his side. &ldquo;Yes, I
      understand that, especially with the sunlight upon it. But at night, Dick,
      with the moon high above that peak there and filling with its light all
      the valleys, do you know, I hardly dare look at it long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; replied Dick, slowly. &ldquo;Barney used to say the same about
      the moonlight on the view from the hillcrest above the Mill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then a silence fell between them. The deepest, nearest thought with each
      was Barney. It was always Barney. Resolutely they refused to allow the
      name to reach their lips except at rare intervals, but each knew how the
      thought of him lurked in the heart, ready to leap into full view with
      every deeper throb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, this won't do,&rdquo; said Margaret, almost sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it won't do,&rdquo; replied Dick, each reading the thought in the other's
      heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am struggling with my report,&rdquo; said Margaret in a business-like tone.
      &ldquo;What shall I say? How shall I begin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your report, eh? Better let me write it. I'll tell them things that will
      make them sit up. What copy there would be in it for the Daily Telegraph!
      The lonely outpost of civilization, the incoming stream of maimed and
      wounded, of sick and lonely, the outgoing stream healed and hopeful, and
      all singing the praises of the Lady of Kuskinook.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, Dick,&rdquo; said Margaret softly. &ldquo;You are forgetting the man who
      travels the lonely trails to the camps and up the gulches for the sick and
      wounded and brings them out on his broncho's back and his own, too,
      watches by them and prays with them, who yarns to them and sings to them
      till they forget their homesickness, which is the sickness the hospital
      cannot cure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, draw it mild, Margaret. Well, we'll give it up. The best part of this
      report will be that that is never written, except on the hearts and in the
      lives of the poor chaps who will think of the Lady of Kuskinook any time
      they happen to be saying their prayers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me, Dick, what shall I say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Begin with the statistics. Typhoids, so many&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What an awful lot there were, two hundred and twenty-seven of them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Dick. &ldquo;But think of what there would have been but for that
      man, Bailey! He's a wonder! He has organized the camps upon a sanitary
      basis, brought in good water from the hills, established hospitals, and
      all that sort of thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you've got it, too,&rdquo; said Margaret, with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Got what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what I call the Bailey bacillus. From the general manager, Mr.
      Fahey, down to Tommy Tate, it seems to have gone everywhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo; replied Dick, laughing. &ldquo;Well, there are some who have
      escaped the tin-horn gang and the whiskey runners. Or rather, they've got
      it, but it's a different kind. Some day they'll kill him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet they say he is&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I know. He does gamble, and when he gets going he's a terror. But
      he's down on the whiskey and on the 'red lights.' You remember the big
      fight at Bull Crossing? It was Bailey pulled me out of that hole. The
      Pioneer was slating me, Colonel Hilliers, the town site agent, was
      fighting me, withdrew his offer of a site for our church unless I'd leave
      the 'red lights' alone, and went everywhere quoting the British army in
      India against me. Even my own men, church members, mind you, one of them
      an elder, thought I should attend to my own business. These people were
      their best customers. Why, they actually went so far as to write to the
      Presbytery that I was antagonizing the people and ruining the Church.
      Well, you remember the big meeting called to protest against this vice?
      The enemy packed the house. Had half a dozen speakers for the 'Liberal'
      side. Unfortunately I had been sent for to see a fellow dying up the line.
      It looked for a complete knockout for me. In came Dr. Bailey, waited till
      they were all through their talk, and then went for them. He didn't speak
      more than ten minutes, but in those ten minutes he crumpled them up
      utterly and absolutely. Colonel Hilliers and the editor of The Pioneer, I
      understand, went white and red, yellow and green, by turns. The crowd
      simply yelled. You know he is tremendously popular with the men. They
      passed my resolution standing on the backs of their seats. Quite true, the
      doctor went from the meeting to a big poker game and stayed at it all
      night. But I'm inclined to forgive him that, and all the more because I am
      told he was after that fellow 'Mexico' and his gang. Oh, it was a fine bit
      of work. I've often wished to meet him, but he's a hard man to find. He
      must be a good sort at bottom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To hear Tommy talk,&rdquo; replied Margaret, &ldquo;you would make up your mind he
      was a saint. He tells the most heart-moving stories of his ways and
      doings, nursing the sick and helping those who are down on their luck.
      Why, he and Ben almost came to blows this morning in regard to the
      comparative merits of the doctor and yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ben, eh? I can never be thankful enough,&rdquo; said Dick earnestly, &ldquo;that you
      brought Ben West with you. It always makes me feel safer to think that he
      is here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ben will agree with you,&rdquo; replied Margaret, &ldquo;I assure you. He assumes
      full care of me and of the whole institution.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good boy, Ben,&rdquo; said Dick, heartily. &ldquo;And he is a kind of link to that
      old home and&mdash;with the past, the beautiful past, the past I like to
      think of.&rdquo; The shadows were creeping up on Dick's face, deepening its
      lines and emphasizing the look of weariness and unrest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A beautiful past it was,&rdquo; replied Margaret gently. &ldquo;We ought to be
      thankful that we have it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you heard anything?&rdquo; inquired Dick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Iola's letter was the last. He had left London shortly after her
      arrival, so Jack Charrington had told her. She didn't know where he had
      gone. Charrington thought to the West somewhere, but there has been no
      word since.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dick put his head on the table and groaned aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind, Dick, boy,&rdquo; said Margaret, laying her hand upon his head as
      if he had been a child, &ldquo;it will all come right some day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't stand it, Margaret!&rdquo; groaned Dick, &ldquo;I shut it out from me for
      weeks and then it all comes over me again. It was my cursed folly that
      wrecked everything! Wrecked Barney's life, Iola's, too, for all I know,
      and mine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must not say wrecked,&rdquo; replied Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What other word is there? Wrecked and ruined. I know what you would say;
      but whatever the next life has for us, there is nothing left in this that
      can atone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That, too, you must not say, Dick,&rdquo; said Margaret. &ldquo;God has something yet
      for us. He always keeps for us better than He has given. The best is
      always before us. Besides,&rdquo; she continued eagerly, &ldquo;He has given you all
      this work to do, this beautiful work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The word recalled Dick. He sat up straight. &ldquo;Yes, yes, I must not forget.
      I am not worthy to touch it. He gave me this chance to work. What else
      should I want? And after all, this is the best. I can't help the
      heart-hunger now and then, but God forbid I should ever say a word of
      anything but gratitude. I was down, down, far down out of sight. He pulled
      me up. Who am I to complain? But I am not complaining! It is not for
      myself. If there were only one word to know he was doing well, was safe!&rdquo;
       He turned suddenly to Margaret with an almost fierce earnestness.
      &ldquo;Margaret, do you think God will give me this?&rdquo; His voice was hoarse with
      the intensity of his passion. &ldquo;Do you know, I sometimes feel that I don't
      want Heaven without this. I never pray for anything else. Wealth, honour,
      fame, I once longed for these. But now these are nothing to me if only I
      knew Barney was right and safe and well. Yes, even my love for you,
      Margaret, the best thing, the truest thing next to my love of my Lord, I'd
      give up to know. But three years have gone since that awful night and not
      a word! It eats and eats and eats into me here,&rdquo; he smote himself hard
      over his heart, &ldquo;till the actual physical pain is at times more than I can
      stand. What do you think, Margaret?&rdquo; he continued, his face quivering
      piteously. &ldquo;Every time I think of God I think of Barney. Every prayer I
      make I ask for Barney. I wake at night and it is Barney I am thinking of.
      Can I stand this long? Will I have to stand it long? Has God forgiven me?
      And when He forgives, does He take away the pain? Sometimes I wonder if
      there is anything in all this I preach!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, Dick!&rdquo; said Margaret, her voice broken with the grief she
      understood only too well. &ldquo;Hush! You must not doubt God. God forgives and
      loves and grieves with our griefs. He will take away the pain as soon as
      He can. You must believe this and wait and trust. God will give him back
      to us. I feel it here.&rdquo; She laid her hand upon her heaving breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some moments Dick was silent. &ldquo;Perhaps so,&rdquo; he said at length. &ldquo;For
      your sake He might. Yes, down in my heart I believe he will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said Margaret, &ldquo;let us go out into the open air, into God's
      sunlight. We shall feel better there. Come, Dick, let us go and see the
      Goat cavort.&rdquo; She took him by the arm and lifted him up. At the door she
      met Ben. &ldquo;I won't be gone long, Ben,&rdquo; she explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay as long as yeh like, Miss Margaret,&rdquo; replied Ben graciously. &ldquo;An'
      the longer yeh stay the better fer the hinstitution.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's an extremely doubtful compliment,&rdquo; laughed Margaret, as they
      passed down the winding path that made its way through the tall red pines
      to the rocky bank of the Goat River. There on a broad ledge of rock that
      jutted out over the boiling water, Margaret seated herself with her back
      against the big red polished bole of a pine tree, while at her feet Dick
      threw himself, reclining against a huge pine root that threw great
      clinging arms here and there about the rocky ledges. It was a sweet May
      day. All the scents and sounds of spring filled up the fragrant spaces of
      the woods. Far up through the great feathering branches gleamed patches of
      blue sky. On every side stretched long aisles pillared with the clean red
      trunks of the pine trees wrought in network pattern. At their feet raged
      the Goat, foaming out his futile fury at the unmoved black rocks. Up the
      rocky sides from the water's edge, bravely clinging to nook and cranny,
      running along ledges, hanging trembling to ragged edges, boldly climbing
      up to the forest, were all spring's myriad tender things wherewith she
      redeems Nature from winter's ugliness. From the river below came gusts of
      misty wind, waves of sound of the water's many voices. It was a spot where
      Nature's kindly ministries got about the spirit, healing, soothing,
      resting.
    </p>
    <p>
      With hardly a word, Dick lay for an hour, watching the pine branches wave
      about him and listening to the voices that came from the woods around and
      from the waters below, till the fever and the doubt passed from his heart
      and he grew strong and ready for the road again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't know how good this is, Margaret,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;all this about me.
      No, it's you. It's you, Margaret. If I could see you oftener I could bear
      it better. You shame me and you make me a man again. Oh, Margaret! if only
      you could let me hope that some day&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look, Dick!&rdquo; she cried, springing to her feet, &ldquo;there's the train.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was still a novelty to see the long line of cars wind its way like some
      great jointed reptile through the woods below.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me, Margaret,&rdquo; continued Dick, &ldquo;is it quite impossible?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Dick!&rdquo; cried the girl, her face full of pain, &ldquo;don't ask me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can it never be, Margaret, in the years to come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She clasped her hands above her heart. &ldquo;Dick,&rdquo; she cried piteously, &ldquo;I
      can't see how it can be. My heart is not my own. While Barney lives I
      could not be true and be another's wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;While Barney lives!&rdquo; echoed Dick blankly. &ldquo;Then God grant you may never
      be mine!&rdquo; He stood straight for a moment, then with a shake of his
      shoulders, as if adjusting a load, he stepped into the path. &ldquo;Come, let us
      go,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There will be letters and I must get to work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Dick dear,&rdquo; said Margaret, her voice full of tender pity, &ldquo;there's
      always our work, thank God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Together they entered the shady path, going back to the work which was to
      them, as to many others, God's salvation.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were a number of letters lying on the office desk that day, but one
      among them made Margaret's heart beat quick. It was from Iola. She caught
      it up and tore it open. It might hold a word of Barney. She was not
      mistaken. Hurriedly she read through Iola's glowing accounts of her
      season's triumph with Wagner. &ldquo;It has been a great, a glorious
      experience,&rdquo; wrote Iola. &ldquo;I cannot be far from the top now. The critics
      actually classed me with the great Malten. Oh, it was glorious. But I am
      tired out. The doctors say there is something wrong, but I think it is
      only that I am tired to death. They say I cannot sing for a year, but I
      don't want to sing for a long, long time. I want you, Margaret, and I want&mdash;oh,
      fool that I was!&mdash;I may as well out with it&mdash;I want Barney. I
      have no shame at all. If I knew where to find him I would ask him to come.
      But he would not. He loathes me, I know. If I were only with you at the
      manse or at the Old Mill I should soon be strong. Sometimes I am afraid I
      shall never be. But if I could see you! I think that is it. I am weary for
      those I love. Love! Love! Love! That is the best. If you have your chance,
      Margaret, don't throw away love! There, this letter has tired me out. My
      face is hot as I read it and my heart is sore. But I must let it go.&rdquo; The
      tears were streaming down Margaret's face as she read.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read it, Dick,&rdquo; she said brokenly, thrusting the letter into his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dick read it and gave it back to her without a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, where is he?&rdquo; cried Margaret, wringing her hands. &ldquo;If we only knew!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The date is a month old,&rdquo; said Dick. &ldquo;I think one of us must go. You must
      go, Margaret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Dick, it must be you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, not I, Margaret! Not I! You remember&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you, Dick. For Barney's sake you must go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For Barney's sake,&rdquo; said Dick, with a sob in his throat. &ldquo;Yes, I'll go.
      I'll go to-night. No, I must go to see a man dying in the Big Horn Canyon.
      Next day I'll be off. I'll bring her back to him. Oh! if I could only
      bring her back for him, dear old boy! God give me this!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Amen,&rdquo; said Margaret with white lips. For hope lives long and dies hard.

    <p>
      The Big Horn flowed by a tortuous and rapid course through rough country
      into the Goat. The trail was bad and, in places, led over high mountain
      shoulders in a way heartbreaking to packers. For this reason, all who knew
      the ways and moods of a canoe chose the water in going up the canyon. True
      enough, there were a number of lift-outs and two rather long portages that
      made the going up pretty stiff, but if a man had skill with the paddle and
      knew the water he might avoid these by running the rapids. Men from the
      Ottawa or from some other north Canadian river, like all true canoemen,
      hated to portage and loved to take the risk of the rapids. Though the
      current was fairly rapid, going upstream was not so difficult as one might
      imagine; that is, if the canoeman happened to know how to take advantage
      of the eddies, how to sneak up the quiet water by the banks, how to put
      the nose of his canoe into the swift water and to hold her so that, as
      Duprez, the keeper of the stopping place at the Landing, said, &ldquo;She would
      walk on de rapide toute suite lak one oiseau.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a bad outbreak of typhoid at the upper camp on the Big Horn, and
      Dr. Bailey had been urgently summoned. The upper camp lay on the other
      side of the Big Horn Lake, twenty miles or more from the steel. The lake
      itself was six miles long by canoe, but by trail it was at least twice
      that. Hence, though there would be some stiff paddling in the trip, the
      doctor did not hesitate in his choice of route. He knew his canoe and
      loved every rib and thwart in her. He had learned also the woodsman's
      trick of going light. A blanket, a tea pail which held his grub,
      consisting of some Hudson Bay hard tack, a hunk of bacon, and a little tea
      and sugar, and his drinking cup constituted his baggage, so that he could
      make the portages in a single carry. Many a mile had he gone, thus
      equipped, both by trail and by canoe, in his journeyings up and down these
      valleys, doing his work for the sick and wounded in the railroad, lumber,
      and tie camps, and more recently in the new-planted mining towns.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a great day for his trip. A stiff breeze upstream would help him in
      his fight with the current and coming down it would be glorious. The sun
      was just appearing over the row of pines that topped the low mountain
      range to the east when he packed his kit and blankets under the gunwale in
      the bow and slipped his canoe into the water. He was about to step in when
      a voice he had not heard for many days arrested him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Duprez! Did you see the preacher pass this way yesterday? He was&mdash;By
      the livin' jumpin' Jemima! Barney!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Ben Fallows, gazing with open mouth on the doctor. With two swift
      steps the doctor was at his side. He grasped Ben by the arm and walked him
      swiftly apart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ben,&rdquo; he said, in a low, stern voice, &ldquo;not a word. I once did you a good
      turn?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ben nodded, still too astonished for speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then listen to what I tell you. No one must know what you know now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;but Miss Margaret and Dick&mdash;&rdquo; gasped Ben.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They don't know,&rdquo; interrupted the doctor, &ldquo;and must not know. Will you
      promise me this, Ben?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove, Barney! I don't&mdash;I don't think&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you hear me, Ben? Do you promise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, by the livin'&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, Ben; I think I can depend on you for the sake of old days.&rdquo; The
      doctor's smile set Ben's head in a whirl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bet, Bar&mdash;Doctor!&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good old boy, Ben. Good-bye, lad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stepped into the canoe and pushed her off into the eddy just above the
      falls by which the Big Horn plunged into the Goat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bo' voyage, M'sieu le Docteur!&rdquo; sang out Duprez. &ldquo;You cache hup de
      preechere. He pass on de riviere las' night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? Who?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;De preechere, Boyle. He's pass on wid canoe las' night. He's camp on de
      Beeg Fall, s'pose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barney held his canoe steady for a moment. &ldquo;Went up last night, did he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oui. Tom Martin on de Beeg Horn camp he's go ver' seeck. He send for
      M'sieu Boyle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he go up alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oui. He's not want nobody. Non. He's good man on de canoe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was an awkward situation. There was a very good chance that he should
      fall in with his brother somewhere on the trip, and that, at all costs, he
      was determined to avoid. For a minute or more he sat holding his canoe,
      calculating time and distances. At length he came to a resolve. He must
      visit the camp on the Big Horn, and he trusted his own ingenuity to avoid
      the meeting he dreaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Duprez! bon jour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bo' jou' an' bon voyage. Gare a vous on de Longue Rapide. You mak' de
      portage hon dat rapide, n'est ce pas?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir. No portage for me, Duprez. I'll run her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prenez garde, M'sieu le Docteur,&rdquo; answered Duprez, shrugging his
      shoulders. &ldquo;Maudit! Dat's ver' fas' water!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't worry about me,&rdquo; cried the doctor. &ldquo;Just watch me take this little
      riffle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bien!&rdquo; cried Duprez, as the doctor slipped his canoe into the eddy and,
      with a smooth, noiseless stroke, sent her up toward the point where the
      stream broke into a riffle at the head of the rapid which led to the falls
      below. It may be that the doctor was putting a little extra weight on his
      paddle or that he did not exercise that unsleeping vigilance which the
      successful handling of the canoe demands, but whatever the cause, when the
      swift water struck the canoe, in spite of all his strength and skill, he
      soon found himself almost in midstream and going down the rapids.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mon Dieu!&rdquo; cried Duprez, dancing in his excitement from one foot to the
      other. &ldquo;A droit! a droit! Non! Don' try for go hup! Come out on de heddy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor did not hear him, but, realizing the hopelessness of the
      frontal attack upon the rapid, he steered his canoe toward the eddy and
      gradually edged her into the quiet water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You come ver' close on de fall, mon gar'!&rdquo; cried Duprez, as the doctor
      paddled slowly up the edge past him. &ldquo;You bes' pass on de portage. Not
      many mans go hup on de rapids comme ca.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Duprez. I hit her too hard, that's all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Once more the doctor moved toward the riffle. He had done the thing before
      and he was not to be beaten now. As the eddy bore him toward the swift
      water again he carefully gauged the angle of attack, so that when the nose
      of the canoe entered the riffle, with the trick that all canoemen know, he
      held her up firm against the water, and, with no very great effort, but by
      skilful manipulations of the force of the current, he shoved her gradually
      across the riffle into the slow water near the farther bank, and with a
      triumphant wave of the paddle disappeared around the bend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's good man,&rdquo; said Duprez to Ben Fallows, who had taken all this time
      to recover from the shock of Barney's sudden appearance. &ldquo;But de
      preechere, he's go hup dat rapide lak one oiseau las' night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did, eh?&rdquo; answered Ben. &ldquo;Well, he didn't put in three summers on the
      Mattawa fer nothin'. He's a bird in the canoe, an' so's his bro&mdash;that
      is&mdash;the doctor there. Wonder if he'll catch him!&rdquo; Ben was much
      excited.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mebbe. He's cache heem comin' down, for sure!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the doctor paddled on with steady, swinging stroke, taking
      advantage of every eddy and cross current, stealing along the bank under
      the overhanging trees, sidling across swift water, lifting his canoe over
      rocky bits, till near mid-day he found himself at the portage below the
      Long Rapid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guess I'll camp on the other side,&rdquo; he said, talking aloud after the
      manner of men who live much alone. He adjusted his paddles on the thwarts,
      hooked his tea pail to his belt, shouldered his canoe, and, taking his
      blanket pack in his hand, made the half mile portage without a &ldquo;set down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There,&rdquo; he said, setting his canoe carefully on the grass, &ldquo;my legs are
      better than my arms. Now we'll grub.&rdquo; He unpacked his tea pail, cut his
      bacon into strips preparatory to toasting, built a fire, drew a pail of
      water, threw in a handful of tea, swung it by a poplar sapling over the
      fire, and sat down to toast his bacon. In fifteen minutes his meal was
      ready&mdash;such a meal as can be had only in the mountains under the open
      sky and at the end of a ten-mile paddle against the stream of the Big
      Horn. After dinner he lit his pipe and stretched himself in the warm
      spring sun for half an hour's quiet think. The old restlessness was coming
      back upon him. His work as Medical Superintendent of the railway
      construction was practically completed. The medical department was
      thoroughly organized and the fight with disease and dirt was pretty much
      over so far as he was concerned. And with the easing of the strain there
      came fiercely upon him the soul fever that had for the last three years
      driven him from land to land. Had it not been that his professional honour
      demanded that he should hold his post and do his work, he had long ago
      left a district where he was kept constantly in mind of what he had so
      resolutely striven to forget. By the exercise of the most assiduous care
      he had prevented a meeting with his brother during the last three months.
      But in this he could not hope to be successful much longer. Before his
      second pipe was smoked he had reached his resolve. &ldquo;I'll pull out of
      this,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;once this Big Horn camp is cleaned up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He packed his kit, carefully extinguished his fire, the mark of a right
      woodsman, slipped his canoe into the water, and set off again. His meeting
      with Ben Fallows seemed somehow to have brought his brother near him
      to-day. Everything was eloquent of those days they had spent together on
      the upper reaches of the Ottawa. The flowing river, the open sky, the
      wood, the fresh air, and, most of all, the slipping canoe spoke to him of
      Dick. The fierce resentment, the bitter sense of loss, that had been as a
      festering in his heart these years, seemed somehow to-day to have lost
      their stinging pain. With every lift of the paddle, with every deep breath
      of the fragrant spring air, with every slip of the canoe, the buoyant
      gladness of those old canoeing days came swelling into his heart, and ere
      he knew he caught himself singing, to the rhythmic swing of paddle and
      shoulders, the old Habitant canoe song:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;En roulant ma boule roulant.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      As often as he found his body swinging to the song, so often did he
      sternly check himself and resolutely set another air going in his head,
      only to find himself in a short space swinging along again to the old song
      to which he and his brother had so often made their canoe slip in those
      great days that now seemed so far away.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;En roulant ma boule,&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      sang his paddle in spite of all he could do. He could hear Dick's clear
      tenor from the bow. &ldquo;Here, confound it! Quit it, I say!&rdquo; he said aloud
      savagely.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;En roulant ma boule roulant,&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      in a clear strong voice came the old song from around the bend. The doctor
      almost dropped his paddle into the stream.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heavens above!&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;What's that? Who's that?&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Visa la noir, tua le blanc,
      Rouli roulant, ma boule roulant,&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      sang the voice. There was only one who could sing that verse just that
      way. With two swift heaves of the paddle he lifted his canoe into the
      overhanging bushes, noiselessly leaped ashore, and pulled his canoe up the
      bank after him. Down the river still came the song, and ever nearer.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;O fils du roi tu es mechant,
      En roulant ma boule.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The doctor cautiously parted the bushes and looked out. Close to the bank
      came the canoe, the singer sitting in the stern, his hat off and his face
      showing brown against the fair hair. How strong he looked and how
      handsome! Barney remembered his own boyish pride in his brother's good
      looks. Yes, he was handsome as ever, and yet he was different. &ldquo;He's
      older, that's it,&rdquo; said the man in the bushes, breathing hard. No, it was
      not that altogether. There was a new gravity, a new dignity, upon the
      face. All at once the song ceased abruptly. The paddle was laid down and
      the canoe allowed to drift. The current carried her still nearer the
      shore. Every line in the face could now be seen. The man peering out
      through the bushes was conscious of a sharp thrust of pain. The lines in
      that grave, handsome face were lines drawn with some sharp instrument of
      grief. The change was not that of years, it was more. Not simply the
      gravity of responsible manhood, it was that, and something else. This was
      the change, the old careless gaiety was gone out of the face and in its
      place sadness, almost gloom. Straight down the river the grave, sad face
      was turned, but the eyes were fixed with unseeing gaze upon the flowing
      water. The canoe was now almost abreast the hiding place in the bushes and
      still drifting. Suddenly the man in the canoe, lifting up his face toward
      the sky, cried out, &ldquo;I'll bring her back, please God, and I'll find him,
      too!&rdquo; The watcher drew back quickly. A stick snapped under his hand. He
      threw himself face down and gripped his hands hard into the moss as if to
      hold himself there. &ldquo;A deer, I guess, but I must get on,&rdquo; he heard a voice
      say, then a flip of the paddle and, looking out through the bushes, he saw
      the swaying figure of the man he most longed and most dreaded to see of
      all men in the world fast disappearing from his view. Twice he raised his
      hands to his lips to call after him, but even as he did so a vision held
      his voice, the vision of a room in a city far away, the girl he loved, and
      this man pressing hot kisses on her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said at length, grinding his foot hard into the moss, &ldquo;let him
      go.&rdquo; But still with straining eyes he gazed after the swaying figure till
      the bend in the river hid it from his sight. Then he sank down on the deep
      moss bank with the air of a man who has just passed through a heavy fight.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rest of the journey upstream was to him a weary drag. The brightness
      had gone out of the light, the sweetness out of the air. A burning pain
      filled his heart and clutched at his throat. The old sore, which his work
      for the sick and wounded had helped to heal over, had been torn open
      afresh, and the first agony of it was upon him again. He arrived at the
      upper camp late at night and weary. But, weary as he was, he toiled on in
      his fight with the typhoid outbreak till near the dawning of the day,
      then, snatching an hour's sleep, he set off down the Big Horn, resolved
      that ere a week had passed he would seek in some far land the forgetting
      which here was impossible to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Steadily the paddle swung all the long morning, but without awakening any
      rhythmic song in his heart. It was a heavy grind to be got through with as
      soon as might be. Even the slip and leap of the canoe failed to quicken
      his heart a single beat. It was still early in the forenoon when he
      reached the Long Rapid. It was a dangerous bit of water, but without a
      moment's considering he stood upright in his canoe and, casting a quick
      glance down the boiling slope, he made his choice of passage. Then getting
      on his knees he braced them firmly against the sides of his canoe and
      before he was well ready found himself in the smooth, steep pitch at the
      crest of that seething incline of plunging water. Two long swallowlike
      swoops, then a mad plunging through a succession of buffeting, curling
      waves that slapped viciously at him as he dashed through, a great heave or
      two over the humping billows at the foot, then the swirl of the eddy
      caught him, and lifted him clear over into the quiet water. One minute of
      wild thrills and the Long Rapid was left behind.

    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't take that quite right,&rdquo; he grumbled. &ldquo;Ought to have lifted her
      sooner. Next time I'll get through dry. Next time?&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;God
      knows if there'll ever be any next time of that water for me.&rdquo; He paddled
      round the eddy toward the shore, intending to dump the water out of his
      canoe. &ldquo;Hello! What in thunder is that?&rdquo; Up against the driftwood, where
      it had been carried by the eddy, a canoe was floating bottom upwards. &ldquo;God
      help us!&rdquo; he groaned. &ldquo;It's his canoe! My God! My God! Dick, boy, you're
      not lost! He'd run these rapids. That's his style. Oh, why didn't I call
      him? We could have done it together safe enough!&rdquo; He stood up in his canoe
      and searched eagerly among the driftwood. &ldquo;Dick! Dick!&rdquo; he called over and
      over again in the wild cry of a wounded man. He paddled over to the canoe
      and examined it. &ldquo;Ah, that's where he hit the rocks, just at the foot. But
      he shouldn't drown here,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;unless they hit him. Let's see,
      where would that eddy take him?&rdquo; For another anxious minute he stood
      observing the run of the water. &ldquo;If he could keep up three minutes,&rdquo; he
      said, &ldquo;he ought to strike that bar.&rdquo; With a few sweeps of his paddle he
      was on the sand bar. &ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; he cried. A paddle lay on the sand just above
      the water mark. &ldquo;That never floated there.&rdquo; He leaped out and drew up his
      canoe, then, dropping on his knees, he examined the marks upon the bar.
      There on the sand was stamped the print of an open hand. &ldquo;Now, God be
      thanked!&rdquo; he cried, lifting his hands toward the sky, &ldquo;he's reached this
      spot. He's somewhere on shore here.&rdquo; Like a dog on scent he followed up
      the marks to the edge of the forest where the bank rose steeply over rough
      rocks. Eagerly he clambered up, his eyes on the alert for any sign. He
      reached the top. A quick glance he threw around him, then with a low cry
      he rushed forward. There, stretched prone on the moss, a little pile of
      brushwood near him, with his match case in his hand, lay his brother. &ldquo;Oh,
      Dick, boy!&rdquo; he cried aloud, &ldquo;not too late, surely!&rdquo; He dropped beside the
      still form, turned him gently over and laid his hand upon his heart. &ldquo;Too
      late! Too late!&rdquo; he groaned. Like a madman he rushed out of the woods,
      flung himself down the rocky bank and toward his canoe, seized his bag and
      scrambled back again. Again, and more carefully, he felt for the
      heartbeat. He thought he could detect a feeble flutter. Hurriedly he
      seized his flask and, forcing open the closed teeth, poured a few drops of
      the whiskey down the throat. But there was no attempt to swallow. &ldquo;We'll
      try it this way.&rdquo; With swift fingers he filled his syringe with the
      whiskey and injected it into the arm. Eagerly he waited with his hand upon
      the feebly fluttering heart. &ldquo;My God! it's coming, I do believe!&rdquo; he
      cried. &ldquo;Now a little strychnine,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;There, that ought to
      help.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Once more he rushed to his canoe and brought his cooking kit and blanket.
      In five minutes he had a fire going and his tea pail swung over it with a
      little more than a cupful of water in it. In five minutes more he had half
      a cup of hot tea ready. By this time the heartbeat could be detected every
      moment growing stronger. Into the tea he poured a little of the stimulant.
      &ldquo;If I can only get this down,&rdquo; he muttered, chafing at the limp hands.
      Once more he lifted the head, pried open the shut jaws, and tried to pour
      a few drops of the liquid down. After repeated attempts he succeeded. Then
      for the first time he observed that his hands were covered with blood.
      Gently he lifted the head and, examining the back of it, detected a great
      jagged wound. &ldquo;Looks bad, bad.&rdquo; He felt the bone carefully and shook his
      head. &ldquo;Fracture, I fear.&rdquo; Heating some more water he cleansed and dressed
      the wound. Half an hour more he spent in his anxious struggle, with
      intense activity utilizing every precious moment, when to his infinite joy
      and relief the life began to come slowly back. &ldquo;Now I must get him to the
      hospital.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There were still five miles to paddle, but it was down stream and there
      were no portages. With swift despatch he cut a large armful of balsam
      boughs. With these and his blankets he made a bed in his canoe, cutting
      out the bow thwart, then lifting the wounded man and picking his steps
      with great care, he carried him to the canoe and laid him upon the balsam
      boughs on his right side. The moment the weight came upon that side a
      groan burst from the pallid lips. &ldquo;Something wrong there,&rdquo; muttered the
      doctor, turning him slightly over. &ldquo;Ah, shoulder out. I'll just settle
      this right now.&rdquo; By dexterous manipulation the dislocation was reduced,
      and at once the patient sank down upon the bed of boughs and lay quite
      still. A little further stimulation brought back the heart to a steadier
      beat. &ldquo;Now, my boy,&rdquo; he said to himself, as he took his place kneeling in
      the stern of the canoe, &ldquo;give her every ounce you have.&rdquo; For half an hour
      without pause, except twice to give his patient stimulant, the sweeping
      paddle and the swaying body kept their rhythmic swing, till down the last
      riffle shot the canoe and in a minute more was at the Landing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Duprez! Here, quick!&rdquo; The doctor stood in the door of the stopping place,
      wet as if he had come from the river, his voice raucous and his face
      white.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mon Dieu!&rdquo; exclaimed the Frenchman, &ldquo;what de mattaire?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor swept a glance about the room. &ldquo;Sick man,&rdquo; he said briefly. &ldquo;I
      want this bed. Get your buckboard, quick.&rdquo; He seized the bed and carried
      it out before the eyes of the astonished Duprez.
    </p>
    <p>
      Duprez was a man slow of speech but quick to act, and by the time the bed
      had been arranged on the buckboard he had his horse between the shafts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now then, Duprez, give me a hand,&rdquo; said the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainment. Bon Dieu! Dat's de bon preechere! Not dead, heh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the doctor, glancing sharply into the haggard face while he
      placed his fingers upon the pulse. &ldquo;No. Now get on. Drive carefully, but
      make time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a few minutes they reached the road that led to the hospital, which was
      well graded and smooth. Duprez sent along his pony at a lope and in a
      short space of time they reached the door of the hospital, where they were
      met by Orderly Ben Fallows on duty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Barney! By the livin' jumpin' Jemima Jebbs!&rdquo; cried Ben. &ldquo;What on earth&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the doctor cut him short. &ldquo;Ben, get the Matron, quick, and get a bed
      ready with warm blankets and hot water bottles. Go, man! Don't gape
      there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still gaping his amazement, Ben skipped in through the hall and up the
      stair as fast as his wooden leg would allow him. He reached the office
      door. &ldquo;Miss Margaret,&rdquo; he gasped, &ldquo;Barney's at the door with a sick man.
      Wants a bed ready. We 'aven't got one&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The look upon the matron's face interrupted the flow of his words.
      &ldquo;Barney?&rdquo; she said, rising slowly to her feet. &ldquo;Barney?&rdquo; she said again,
      her hand clutching the desk and holding hard. &ldquo;What do you mean, Ben?&rdquo; The
      words came slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He wants a bed for a sick man and we 'aven't&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret took a step toward him. &ldquo;Ben,&rdquo; she said, in breathless haste,
      &ldquo;get my room ready. But first tell Nurse Crane to come to me quick. Go,
      Ben.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The orderly hurried away, leaving her alone. With trembling hands she shut
      the door, turned toward her desk, and there stood, both hands pressed hard
      to her heart, fighting hard to control the tumultuous tides that surged
      through her heart and thundered in her ears. &ldquo;Barney! Barney!&rdquo; she
      whispered. &ldquo;Oh, Barney, at last!&rdquo; The blue eyes were wide open and all
      aglow with the tender light of her great love. &ldquo;Barney,&rdquo; she said over and
      over, &ldquo;my love, my love, my&mdash;ah, not mine&mdash;&rdquo; A sob caught her
      voice. Over her desk hung a copy of Hoffman's great picture, the Christ
      kneeling in Gethsemane. She went close to the picture. &ldquo;O Christ!&rdquo; she
      cried brokenly, &ldquo;I, too! Help me!&rdquo; A knock came to the door, Nurse Crane
      entered. Margaret quickly turned toward her desk again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dr. Bailey is at the door with a patient,&rdquo; said the nurse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dr. Bailey?&rdquo; echoed Margaret, not daring to look up, her trembling hands
      fluttering among the papers on the desk. &ldquo;Go to him, Nurse, and get what
      he wants. Take my room. I shall follow in a moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Once more she was alone. Again she stood before the picture of the Christ,
      the words of the great submission ringing through the chambers of her
      soul. &ldquo;Not my will but Thine be done.&rdquo; She pressed nearer the picture,
      gazing into that strong, patient, suffering face through the rain of
      welcome tears. &ldquo;O Christ!&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;dear blessed Christ! I
      understand&mdash;now. Help me! Help me!&rdquo; Then, after a pause, &ldquo;Not my
      will! Not my will!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The strife was past. Quietly she went to the lavatory that stood in the
      corner of her office, bathed her eyes, smoothed away the signs of struggle
      from her face, and went forth serene to her duty and her cross. In the
      hall she met Barney. With a quick, light step she was at his side, both
      hands stretched out. &ldquo;Barney!&rdquo; &ldquo;Margaret!&rdquo; was all they said. For a moment
      or two Barney stood holding her hands, gazing without a word into the
      sweet face, so pale, so beautiful, so serenely strong. Twice he essayed to
      speak, but the words choked in his throat. Turning abruptly away he
      pointed to the figure under the grey blanket on the camp bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've brought&mdash;you&mdash;Dick,&rdquo; at last he said hoarsely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dick! Hurt? Not&mdash;&rdquo; She halted before the dreaded word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, injured. Badly, I fear, but I hope&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The room is ready,&rdquo; said Nurse Crane.
    </p>
    <p>
      At once all other thoughts and emotions gave way to the immediate demands
      of their common duty. They had work to do, and they had trained themselves
      to obey without thought of self that Divine call to serve the suffering.
      Together they toiled at their work, Margaret noting with delighted wonder
      the quick fingers and the finished skill that cleansed and probed and
      dressed the wound in the head and made thorough examination for other
      injury or ill, Barney keenly conscious of the efficiency of the silent,
      steady helper at his side whose quick eye and hand anticipated his every
      want. At length their work was done and they stood looking down upon the
      haggard face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is resting now,&rdquo; said Barney, in a low voice. &ldquo;The fracture is not
      serious, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Dick,&rdquo; said Margaret, passing her hand over his brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      At her touch and voice Dick moaned and opened his eyes. Barney quickly
      stepped back out of sight. For a moment or two the eyes wandered about the
      room, then rested on Margaret's face in a troubled, inquiring gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, Dick, dear?&rdquo; said Margaret, bending over him.
    </p>
    <p>
      For answer his hand began to move feebly toward his breast as if seeking
      something.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know. The letter, Dick?&rdquo; A look of intelligence lighted the eye.
      &ldquo;That's all right, Dick. I shall get it to Barney. Barney is here, you
      know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A hand grasped her arm. &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said Barney in stern command. &ldquo;Say nothing
      about me.&rdquo; But she heeded him not. For a moment longer the sick man's gaze
      lingered on her face. A faint smile of content overspread the drawn
      features, then the look of intelligence faded and the eyes closed wearily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said Barney, moving toward the door, &ldquo;he is better quiet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Leaving the nurse in charge, they went together toward the office.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did you find him?&rdquo; asked Margaret as she gave Barney a seat. Then
      Barney told her the story of how he had chanced upon the canoe and had
      discovered Dick lying insensible in the woods.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was God's leading, Barney,&rdquo; said Margaret gently, when the story was
      done; but to this he made no reply. &ldquo;Is there serious danger, do you
      think?&rdquo; she inquired in an anxious voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will recover,&rdquo; replied Barney. &ldquo;All he requires is careful nursing,
      and that you can give him. I shall wait till to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow? And then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am leaving this country next week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leaving the country? And why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My work here is done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely there is much yet to do, and you have just begun to do such great
      things. Why should you leave now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barney waited a few moments in silence as if pondering an answer.
      &ldquo;Margaret, I must go,&rdquo; he finally burst forth. &ldquo;You know I must go. I
      can't live within touch of him and forget!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive, you mean, Barney.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, forgive, if you like,&rdquo; he replied sullenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Barney,&rdquo; replied Margaret earnestly, &ldquo;this is unworthy of you, and in the
      face of God's mercy to-day how can you hold resentment in your heart?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can I? God knows, or the Devil. For three years I have fought it, but
      it is there. It is there!&rdquo; He struck his hand hard upon his breast. &ldquo;I
      can't forget that he ruined my life! But for him I believe in my soul I
      should have won&mdash;her to me! At a critical moment he came in and
      ruined&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Barney! Barney, listen to me!&rdquo; cried Margaret impetuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barney sprang to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you must listen to me. Sit down.&rdquo; Barney obeyed her word and sat
      down. &ldquo;Now, hear me, and hear me fairly. I am not going to say that Dick
      was free from blame, nor was Iola either. Whose was the greater I can't
      tell. They were both young and, to a certain extent, inexperienced in the
      ways of life. Circumstances threw them much together and on terms of
      almost brotherly and sisterly intimacy. That was a mistake. They ignored
      conventions that can never be safely ignored. Just at that time Dick's
      life was made hard for him. His Church had rejected him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rejected him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, rejected him. He was refused license by the Presbytery, was branded
      as a heretic and outcast from work.&rdquo; Margaret's voice grew bitter. &ldquo;Do you
      wonder that he grew hard? Perhaps they could not help it&mdash;I can't say&mdash;but
      he grew hard. Yes, and worse than that, grew away from his faith, from his
      friends, and from those things that keep men straight and strong. He grew
      weak. The hour of temptation came upon him. You and I have seen enough of
      that side of life to know what that means. He broke faith with you&mdash;no,
      not with you. He was loyal to you, but he broke faith with himself and
      with her. For a single moment, that moment at which you appeared, he
      yielded to passion, and bitterly, terribly, has he suffered since that
      moment. How terribly no one knows. He has tried to find you, but you would
      not be found. He wronged you, Barney, but you have made him and all of us
      suffer much.&rdquo; The voice that had gone on so bravely and so firmly here
      suddenly trembled and broke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Made you suffer!&rdquo; cried Barney, with bitter scorn. &ldquo;How can you speak of
      suffering? You have everything! I have lost all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything?&rdquo; echoed Margaret faintly. &ldquo;Ah, Barney, how little you know!
      But, no matter, God has brought you together and you must not do this
      wicked thing. You must not continue to break our hearts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Break your hearts? Margaret, what's the use of words? I had a heart, too,
      and a brother whom I loved and trusted as myself, yes, more than myself,
      and&mdash;I had&mdash;Iola. All I have lost. My work satisfies me for a
      few months, but try as I can this awful thing hunts me down and drives me
      mad. There is nothing in life left for me. And there might have been much
      but for&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop, Barney!&rdquo; cried Margaret impulsively. &ldquo;There is much still left for
      you. God is good. How much better than we. You can't forgive a
      fellow-sinner. Oh, shame! But He forgives and forgets, and surely you
      ought to try&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try! Try! Heavens above, Margaret! Try! Do you think I haven't tried?
      That thing is there! there!&rdquo; smiting on his breast again. &ldquo;Can you tell me
      how to rid myself of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Barney, I think I can tell you. God's great goodness will do this
      for you. Listen,&rdquo; she said, putting up her hand to stay his words, &ldquo;God is
      bringing a great joy to you to shame you and to soften you. Here, read
      this.&rdquo; She handed him Iola's letter, went to the window, and stood with
      her back to him, looking out upon the great sweeping valley below.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Margaret!&rdquo; The hoarse voice called her back to him. His hard, proud,
      sullen reserve was shattered, gone. His lips were quivering, his hands
      trembling. The girl was touched to the heart. &ldquo;Margaret,&rdquo; he cried
      brokenly, &ldquo;what does this mean?&rdquo; He was terribly shaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It means that she wants you, that she needs you. Dick was going to-morrow
      to bring her back to you, Barney. That was his one desire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To bring her to me? To bring her back to me? Dick? Dear old boy! and I&mdash;Oh,
      Margaret!&rdquo; He put his trembling hands out to her. &ldquo;Forgive me! God forgive
      me! Poor Dick! I'll see him!&rdquo; He started toward the door. &ldquo;No, not how,&rdquo;
       he cried, striving in vain to control himself. &ldquo;I am mad! mad! For three
      long years I have carried this cursed thing in my heart! It's gone! It's
      gone, Margaret! Do you hear? It's gone!&rdquo; He was shouting aloud. &ldquo;I feel
      right toward Dick, my brother!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, Barney dear,&rdquo; said the girl, tears running down her face, &ldquo;you will
      wake him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; he cried, in an eager whisper, &ldquo;I'll be careful. Poor old boy,
      he has suffered, too. Dear old Dick! And she wants me! I'll go to-night!
      Yes, to-night! What's the date?&rdquo; He tore at the envelope with trembling
      hands. The letter dropped to the floor. Margaret caught it up and opened
      it for him. &ldquo;A month ago and more! Yes, I'll go to-night. Oh, Margaret,
      what a blasted fool I am! I can't get myself in hand.&rdquo; Suddenly he threw
      himself into his chair. &ldquo;Here!&rdquo; he ground out between his teeth, &ldquo;get
      quiet!&rdquo; He sat for a few moments absolutely still, gathering strength to
      command himself. At length he got himself in hand. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said in a
      quiet voice, &ldquo;I shall not go tonight. I shall wait till Dick is better.
      Just now he must be kept quiet. In the morning I expect to see him very
      much himself. We can only wait and see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Through the night they waited, Barney struggling mightily to hold himself
      in perfect control, Margaret quietly doing what was to be done, her whole
      spirit breathing of that self-forgetting love which finds its highest joy
      in the joy of another. At the break of day the nurse came to the door and
      found them still waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Boyle is awake and is asking for you, Miss Robertson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me go to him,&rdquo; cried Barney. &ldquo;Don't fear.&rdquo; His voice was still
      vibrating, but his manner was calm and steady. He was master of himself
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Margaret, &ldquo;go to him.&rdquo; Then as the door closed she stood once
      more before the Gethsemane scene. &ldquo;Thank God, thank God,&rdquo; she said softly,
      &ldquo;for them the pain is over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For half an hour she waited and then went up to the sickroom. She opened
      the door softly, went in and stood gazing till her eyes grew dim. On the
      pillow, face down, Barney's head lay close to Dick's, whose arm was thrown
      about his brother's neck, and on Dick's face shone a look of rapturous
      peace. As Margaret moved to leave the room Dick called her in a voice
      faint, but full of joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Margaret,&rdquo; he said, a smile breaking like light through a dark cloud, &ldquo;my
      head was broken, but I'd have all the bones in my body broken, just to
      have Barney set them. We're all right, eh, boy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Slowly Barney raised his face, tear-marked, worn, but radiant with a peace
      it had not known for many a day. &ldquo;Yes, old chap,&rdquo; he said in a voice still
      tremulous in spite of all his self-command, &ldquo;we're right again, and,
      please God, we'll keep so.&rdquo;

    <h3>
      TO WHOM HE FORGAVE MOST
    </h3>
    <p>
      For three days Dick made steady progress toward health, but his progress
      was slow. Any mental effort produced severe pain in his head and sufficed
      to raise his temperature several points. As he gained in strength and
      became more and more clear in his thinking his anxiety in regard to his
      work began to increase. His congregations would be waiting him on Sunday,
      and he could not bear to think of their being disappointed. With no small
      effort had he gathered them together, and a single failure on his part he
      knew would have disastrous effect upon the attendance. He was especially
      concerned about the service at Bull Crossing, which was at once the point
      where the work was the most difficult, and, at the present juncture, most
      encouraging. Under his instructions Barney sought to secure a substitute
      for the service at Bull Crossing, but without result. Preachers were
      scarce in that country and every preacher had more work in sight than he
      could overtake. And so Dick fretted and wrought himself into a fever,
      until the doctor took him sternly to task.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't see that it's your business to worry, Dick,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I suppose
      you consider yourself as working under orders, and it is your belief,
      isn't it, that the One who gives the orders is the One who has laid you
      down here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's true,&rdquo; said Dick wearily, &ldquo;but there's the people. A lot of them
      come a long way. It's been hard to get them together, and I hate to
      disappoint them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we'll get someone,&rdquo; replied Barney. &ldquo;We're a pretty hard
      combination to beat, aren't we, Margaret? There will be a man to take the
      service at Bull Crossing if I have to take it myself&mdash;a desperate
      resort, indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not, Barney?&rdquo; asked Dick. &ldquo;You could do it well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? Did you ever hear me talk? I can talk a little with my fingers, but
      my tongue is unconscionably slow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was a man once slow of speech,&rdquo; replied Dick quietly, &ldquo;but he was
      given a message and he led a nation into freedom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barney nodded. &ldquo;I remember him. But he could do things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Dick, &ldquo;but he believed God could do things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps so. That was rather long ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With God,&rdquo; replied Dick earnestly, &ldquo;there is no such thing as long ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the same,&rdquo; said Barney, &ldquo;I guess these things don't happen now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe they happen,&rdquo; replied his brother, &ldquo;where God finds a man who
      will take his life in his hand and go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don't know about that,&rdquo; replied Barney, &ldquo;but I do know that you
      must quit talking and sleep. Now, hear me, drop that meeting out of your
      mind. I'll look after it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Saturday came and, in spite of every effort on Barney's part, he found
      no one for the service at Bull Crossing next day. There was still a slight
      hope that one of the officials of the congregation would consent to be a
      stop-gap for the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess I'll have to take that service myself, Margaret,&rdquo; said Barney
      laughingly. &ldquo;Wouldn't the crowd stare? They'd hear the sermon of their
      lives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be a good sermon, Barney,&rdquo; replied Margaret quietly. &ldquo;And why
      should you not say something to the men?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense, Margaret!&rdquo; cried Barney impatiently. &ldquo;You know the thing is
      utterly absurd. What sort of man am I to preach? A gambler, a swearer, and
      generally bad. They all know me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They know only a part of you, Barney,&rdquo; said Margaret gently. &ldquo;God knows
      all of you, and whatever you have been you are no gambler today, and you
      are not a bad man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Barney slowly, &ldquo;I am no gambler, nor will I ever be again.
      But I have been a hard, bad man. For three years I carried hate in my
      heart. I could not forgive and didn't want to be forgiven. And that, I
      believe, was the cause of all my badness. But&mdash;somehow&mdash;I don't
      deserve it&mdash;but I've been awfully well treated. I deserved hell, but
      I've got a promise of heaven. And I'd be glad to do something for&mdash;&rdquo;
       He paused abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, you've got your sermon, Barney,&rdquo; said Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Forgive and ye shall be forgiven.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's the sermon someone wants to preach to me, but it's not for me to
      preach. The thing is preposterous. I'll get one of those fellows at the
      Crossing to take the meeting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On Saturday evening Dick again reverted to the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not anxious, Barney,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but who's going to take the meeting
      to-morrow night at Bull Crossing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, look here,&rdquo; said Barney, &ldquo;Monday morning you'll hear all about it.
      Meantime, don't ask questions. Margaret and I are responsible, and that
      ought to be enough. You never knew her to fail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, nor you, Barney,&rdquo; said Dick, sinking back with a sigh of
      satisfaction. &ldquo;I know it will be all right. Are you going down to-morrow
      evening?&rdquo; he inquired, turning to Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I?&rdquo; exclaimed Margaret. &ldquo;What would I do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course you are going. It will do you a lot of good,&rdquo; said Barney. &ldquo;You
      may have to preach yourself or hold my coat while I go in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A sudden gleam of joy in the eyes, a flush of red upon the cheek, and the
      quick following pallor told Dick the thoughts that rushed through
      Margaret's heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Dick gravely, &ldquo;you will go down, too, Margaret. It will do you
      good, and I don't need you here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Many anxious days had Barney passed in his life, but never had he found
      himself so utterly blocked by unmanageable circumstances and
      uncompromising facts as he found facing him that Sunday morning. He
      confided his difficulty to Tommy Tate, whom he had found in &ldquo;Mexico's&rdquo;
       saloon toning up his system after his long illness, and whom he had
      straightway carried off with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess it's either you or me, Tommy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bedad, it's yersilf that c'd do that same, an' divil a wan av the bhoys
      will 'Mexico' git this night, wance the news gits about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't talk rot, Tommy,&rdquo; said Barney angrily, for the chance of his being
      forced to take his brother's place, which all along had seemed to be
      extremely remote, had come appreciably nearer. With the energy of
      desperation he spent the hours of the afternoon visiting, explaining,
      urging, cajoling, threatening anyone of the members or adherents of the
      congregation at Bull Crossing in whom might be supposed to dwell the
      faintest echo of the spirit of the preacher. One after another, however,
      those upon whom he had built his hopes failed him. One was out of town,
      another he found sick in bed, and a third refused point blank to consider
      the request, so that within a few minutes of the hour of service he found
      himself without a preacher and wholly desperate, and for the first time he
      seriously faced the possibility of having to take the service himself. He
      returned to the shack of one of his brother's parishioners, where Margaret
      was staying, and abruptly announced to her his failure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't get a soul, and of course I can't do it, Margaret. You know, I
      can't,&rdquo; he repeated, in answer to the look upon her face. &ldquo;Why, it was
      only last week I fleeced 'Mexico' out of a couple of hundred. He would
      give a good deal more to get even. The crowd would hoot me out of the
      building. Not that I care for that&rdquo;&mdash;the long jaws came hard together&mdash;&ldquo;but
      it's just too ghastly to think of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn't so very terrible, Barney,&rdquo; said Margaret, her voice and eyes
      uniting in earnest persuasion. &ldquo;You are not the man you were last week.
      You know you are not. You are quite different, and you will be different
      all your life. A great change has come to you. What made the change? You
      know it was God's great mercy that took the bitterness out of your heart
      and that changed everything. Can't you tell them this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell them that, Margaret? Great Heavens! Could I tell them that? What
      would they say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Barney,&rdquo; asked Margaret, &ldquo;you are not afraid of them? You are not ashamed
      to tell what you owe to God?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Afraid? It was an ugly word for Barney to swallow. No, he was not afraid,
      but his native diffidence, intensified by these recent years of
      self-repression and self-absorption, had made all speech difficult to him,
      but more especially speech that revealed the deeper movements of his soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Margaret, I'm not afraid,&rdquo; he said slowly. &ldquo;But I'd rather have them
      take the flesh off that arm bit by bit than get up and speak to them. I'd
      have to tell them the truth, don't you see, Margaret? How can I do that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All that you say must be the truth, Barney, of course,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;But
      you will tell them just what you will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With these words she turned away, leaving him silent and fighting a
      desperate fight. His word passed to his brother must be kept. But soon a
      deeper issue began to emerge. His honour was involved. His sense of
      loyalty was touched. He knew himself to be a different man from the man
      who, last week, in &ldquo;Mexico's&rdquo; saloon, had beaten his old antagonist at the
      old game. His consciousness of himself, of his life purposes, of his
      outlook, of his deepest emotions, was altogether a different
      consciousness. And more than all, that haunting, pursuing restlessness was
      gone and, in its place, a deep peace possessed him. The process by which
      this had been achieved he could not explain, but the result was
      undeniable, and it was due, he knew, to an influence the source of which
      he frankly acknowledged to be external to himself. The words of the beaten
      and confounded pagan magic-workers came to him, &ldquo;This is the finger of
      God.&rdquo; He could not deny it. Why should he wish to hide it? It became clear
      to him, in these few minutes of intense soul activity, that there was a
      demand being made upon him as a man of truth and honour, and as the
      struggle deepened in his soul and the possibility of his refusing the
      demand presented itself to his mind, there flashed in upon him the picture
      of a man standing in the midst of enemies, the flickering firelight
      showing his face vacillating, terror-stricken, hunted. From the trembling
      lips of the man he heard the words of base denial, &ldquo;I know not the man,&rdquo;
       and in his heart there rose a cry, &ldquo;O Christ! shall I do this?&rdquo; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; came
      the answer, strong and clear, from his lips, &ldquo;I will not do this thing, so
      help me God.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret turned quickly around and looked at him in dismay. &ldquo;You won't?&rdquo;
       she said faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll take the service,&rdquo; he replied, setting the long jaws firmly
      together. And with that they went forth to the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      They found the place crowded far beyond its capacity, for through Tommy
      Tate it had been noised abroad that Dr. Bailey was to preach. There were
      wild rumors, too, that the doctor had &ldquo;got religion,&rdquo; although &ldquo;Mexico&rdquo;
       and his friends scouted the idea as utterly impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He ain't the kind. He's got too much nerve,&rdquo; was &ldquo;Mexico's&rdquo; verdict,
      given with a full accompaniment of finished profanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tommy's evidence, however, was strong enough to create a profound
      impression and to awaken an expectation that rose to fever pitch when
      Barney and Margaret made their way through the crowds and took their
      places, Margaret at the organ, which Dick usually played himself, and
      Barney at the table upon which were the Bible and the Hymn-book. His face
      wore the impenetrable, death-like mark which had so often baffled &ldquo;Mexico&rdquo;
       and his gang over the poker table. It fascinated &ldquo;Mexico&rdquo; now. All the
      years of his wicked manhood &ldquo;Mexico&rdquo; had, on principle, avoided anything
      in the shape of a religious meeting, but to-day the attraction of a poker
      player preaching proved irresistible. It was with no small surprise that
      the crowd saw &ldquo;Mexico,&rdquo; with two or three of his gang, make their way
      toward the front to the only seats left vacant.
    </p>
    <p>
      When it became evident beyond dispute that his old-time enemy was to take
      the preacher's place, &ldquo;Mexico&rdquo; leaned over to his pal, &ldquo;Peachy&rdquo; Bud, who
      sat between him and Tommy Tate, and muttered in an undertone audible to
      those in his immediate neighbourhood, &ldquo;It's his old game. He's runnin' a
      blank bluff. He ain't got the cards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But painful experience shook &ldquo;Peachy's&rdquo; confidence in his friend's
      judgment on this particular point, and he only ventured to reply, &ldquo;He's
      got the lead.&rdquo; &ldquo;Peachy&rdquo; preferred to await developments.
    </p>
    <p>
      The opening hymn was sung with the hearty fervour that marks the musical
      part of any religious service in the West. But there was in the voices
      that curious thrill that is at once the indication and the quickening of
      intense excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This here'll show what's in his hand,&rdquo; said &ldquo;Peachy,&rdquo; when the moment for
      prayer arrived. &ldquo;Peachy&rdquo; was not unfamiliar with religious services, and
      had, with unusual keenness of observation, noted that when a man undertook
      to pray he must, if he be true, reveal the soul within him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mexico&rdquo; grunted a dubious affirmative. But &ldquo;Peachy&rdquo; was disappointed, for
      in a voice reverent, but unimpassioned, the preacher for the day led the
      people's devotions, using the great words taught those men long ago who
      knew not how to pray, &ldquo;Our Father who art in Heaven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blanked if he ain't bluffed again! We've got to wait till he begins to
      shoot, I guess,&rdquo; said &ldquo;Peachy,&rdquo; mixing his figures.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lesson was the parable of the unforgiving debtor and the parallel
      passage containing the matchless story of the sinful woman and the proud
      Pharisee. In the reading of these lessons the voice, which had hitherto
      carried the strident note of nervousness, mellowed into rich and subduing
      fulness. The men listened with that hushed attention that they give when
      words are getting to the heart. The utter simplicity of the reader's
      manner, the dignity of his bearing, the quiet strength that showed itself
      in every tone, and the undercurrent of emotion that made the voice vibrate
      like a stringed instrument, all these, with the marvellous authoritative
      tenderness of the great utterance on a theme so closely touching their
      daily experience, gripped these men and held them in complete thrall.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the reading was done the doctor stood for some moments looking his
      audience quietly in the face. He knew them all, men from the camps and the
      line, men from the hills and mining claims, men from the saloons and the
      gambling hells. Many he had treated professionally, some he had himself
      nursed back to health, others he had rescued from those desperate moods
      that end in death. Others again&mdash;and these not a few&mdash;he had
      &ldquo;cleaned out&rdquo; at poker or &ldquo;Black Jack.&rdquo; But to all of them he was &ldquo;white.&rdquo;
       Not so to himself. It was a very humble man and a very penitent, that
      stood looking them in the face. His first words were a confession.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not worthy to stand here before you,&rdquo; he began, in a low, clear
      tone, &ldquo;God knows, you know, and I know. I am here for two reasons: one is
      that I promised my brother, the Reverend Richard Boyle&rdquo;&mdash;here a gasp
      of surprise was audible from one and another in the audience&mdash;&ldquo;a man
      you know to be a good man, better than ever I can hope to be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Durned if he is!&rdquo; grunted &ldquo;Peachy&rdquo; to &ldquo;Mexico.&rdquo; &ldquo;Ain't in the same
      bunch!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' that's thrue fer ye,&rdquo; answered Tommy. But &ldquo;Mexico&rdquo; paid no heed to
      these remarks. He was staring at the speaker with the look of a man wholly
      bewildered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the other reason is,&rdquo; continued, the doctor, &ldquo;that I have something
      which I think it fair to tell you men. Like a lot of you, I have carried a
      name that is not my own.&rdquo; Here significant looks were gravely exchanged.
      &ldquo;They gave it to me by mistake when I reached the Pass. I didn't care much
      at that time about names or anything else, so I let it go. There are times
      in a fellow's life when he's not unwilling to forget his name. My name is
      Boyle.&rdquo; And then, in sentences simple, clean-cut, and terse, he told of
      his boyhood days, the Old Mill, the two boys growing up together, their
      love for and their loyalty to each other, their struggles and their
      success. Then came a pause. The speaker had obviously come to a difficult
      spot in his story. The men waited in earnest, grave, and deeply moved
      expectation. &ldquo;At that time a great calamity came to me&mdash;no matter
      what&mdash;and it threw me clear off my balance. I lost my head and lost
      my nerve, and just then&mdash;&rdquo; again the speaker paused, as if to gather
      strength to continue&mdash;&ldquo;and just then my brother did me a wrong. Not
      being in a condition to judge fairly, I magnified the wrong a
      thousand-fold and I tried to tear my brother out of my heart. I could not
      and I would not forgive him, and I couldn't cease to love him. I lived a
      life of misery, misery so great that it drove me from everything in earth
      that I held dear, and for three years I went steadily down from bad to
      worse. I came to the Crow's Nest a year and a half ago. My life since then
      most of you know well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bedad we do! An' Hivin bliss ye!&rdquo; burst forth Tommy Tate, who had found
      the greatest difficulty in controlling his emotions of indignation and
      grief during the doctor's self-condemnatory tale. At Tommy's words a quiet
      thrill ran through the crowd, for few men of those present but held the
      doctor in affectionate esteem. The sins of which he was conscious and
      which humiliated him before them were, in their estimation, but trivial.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment the speaker was thrown off his track by Tommy's outburst,
      but, recovering himself, he went on. &ldquo;It would be wrong to say that my
      life here has been all bad. I have been able to serve many of you, but my
      work has done far more for me than it has for you. But for it I should
      have long ago gone down out of sight. I confess that it has been a hard
      fight for me, an awful fight, to stay at my work, but the day that I heard
      that my brother was your missionary brought me the hardest fight I had had
      for many a day. I wanted to get away from the past. For nearly four years
      I had been carrying round a heart with hell in it. I had begun to forget a
      little, but that day it all came back. This week I met my brother. I found
      him dying, almost dead, up in the Big Horn Valley. That morning my heart
      carried hell in it. To-day it is like what I think heaven must be.&rdquo; As he
      spoke these words a light broke over his face, and again he stood silent,
      striving to regain control of his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blanked if he don't hold the cards!&rdquo; said &ldquo;Mexico&rdquo; in a thick voice to
      &ldquo;Peachy&rdquo; Budd.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Full flush,&rdquo; answered &ldquo;Peachy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mexico&rdquo; was in the grasp of the elemental emotions of his untutored
      nature. His swarthy face was twisted like the face of a man in torture.
      His black eyes were gleaming like two fires from under his shaggy
      eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How it came about,&rdquo; continued the doctor, in a quiet, even tone, &ldquo;I am
      not going to tell. But this I am going to say, I know it was God's great
      mercy, His great kindness it was that took the hate out of my heart. I
      forgave my brother that day&mdash;and&mdash;God forgave me. That's all
      there is to it. It's the biggest thing that has ever come to me. I have
      got my brother back just as when we were little chaps at the Old Mill.&rdquo; A
      sudden choke caught the speaker's voice. The firm lips quivered and the
      strong hands writhed themselves in a mighty effort to master the emotions
      surging through his soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tommy Tate was openly sniffling and wiping his eyes. &ldquo;Peachy&rdquo; Budd was
      swearing audibly his emotions, but, most of all, &ldquo;Mexico's&rdquo; swarthy face
      betrayed the intensity of his feelings. He had grasped the back of the
      seat before him and was leaning toward the speaker as if held under an
      hypnotic spell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the doctor, getting his voice steady, went on. &ldquo;I have just a word
      more to say. I would like to give credit for this that happened to me to
      the One we have been reading about this afternoon, and I do so with all my
      heart. I came near being coward enough and mean enough to go away without
      owning this up before you. How He did it, I do not pretend to know. I'm
      not a preacher. But He did it, and that's what chiefly concerns me. And
      what He did for me I guess He can do for any of you. And now I've got to
      square up some things. 'Mexico'&mdash;&rdquo; At the sound of his name &ldquo;Mexico&rdquo;
       started violently and, involuntarily, his hand went, with a quick motion,
      toward his hip&mdash;&ldquo;I've taken a lot from you. I'd like to pay it back.&rdquo;
       The voice was humble, earnest, kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mexico,&rdquo; taken by surprise, shifted his tobacco to the other side of his
      mouth, stood up and drawled out, &ldquo;Haow? Me? Pay me back? Blanked if you
      do! It was a squar' deal, wa'n't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I played fair, 'Mexico,' but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then go to hell!&rdquo; &ldquo;Mexico's&rdquo; tone was not at all unfriendly, but his
      vocabulary was limited, and he was evidently deeply stirred. &ldquo;We're squar'
      an'&mdash;an' blanked if I don't believe ye're white! Put it thar!&rdquo; With a
      single stride &ldquo;Mexico&rdquo; was over the seat that separated him from the
      platform and reached out his hand. The doctor took it in a hard grip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, men,&rdquo; he said, when &ldquo;Mexico&rdquo; had resumed his seat, &ldquo;I've got
      to do something with this money. I've got at least five thousand that
      don't belong to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Tain't ours,&rdquo; called a voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Men,&rdquo; continued the doctor, &ldquo;I'm starting out on a new track. I want to
      straighten out the past all I can. I can't keep this money. I'd feel like
      a thief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But such an ethical code was beyond the men, and one and all protested to
      each other, in tones that were quite audible over the hall and with
      anathemas of more or less terrible import, that the money was not theirs
      and that they would not touch it. The doctor listened for a minute or more
      and then, with the manner of one closing a discussion, he said, &ldquo;All
      right. If you won't help me I'll have to find some way, myself, of
      straightening this up. This is all I have to say. I'm no preacher and I'm
      not any better than the rest of you, but I'd like to be a great deal
      better man than I am, and, with God's help, I'm going to try. That's my
      religion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And with these words he sat down, leaving the people still staring at him
      and waiting for something in the way of closing exercises to what must
      have been the most extraordinary religious service in all their
      experience. Softly, Margaret began to play the old hymn, &ldquo;Nearer, My God,
      to Thee!&rdquo; The men, accepting it as a signal, rose to their feet and began
      to sing, and with these great words of aspiration ringing through their
      hearts they passed out into the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the many who lingered to speak to the doctor were &ldquo;Mexico,&rdquo;
       &ldquo;Peachy,&rdquo; and, of course, his faithful follower, Tommy Tate. &ldquo;Mexico&rdquo; drew
      him off to one corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, pard,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;you've done me up many a time before, but blanked
      if yeh haven't hit me this time the worst yet! When you was talkin' about
      them two little chaps&mdash;&rdquo; here &ldquo;Mexico's&rdquo; hard face began to work and
      his voice to quiver&mdash;&ldquo;you put the knife right in here. I had a
      brother once,&rdquo; he continued in a husky voice. &ldquo;I wish to God someone had
      choked the blank nonsense out of me, for I done him a wrong an' I wasn't
      man enough to own up. An' that's what started me in all this hell business
      I've been chasin' ever since.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor took him by the arm and walked him out of the room. &ldquo;Take Miss
      Robertson home,&rdquo; he said to Tommy as he passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour later he appeared, pale and as nearly exhausted as his iron nerve
      and muscle would allow him to be. &ldquo;I say, Margaret, this thing is
      wonderful! There's no explaining it by any physical or mental law that I
      know.&rdquo; Then, after a pause, he added, with an odd thrill of tenderness in
      his voice, &ldquo;I believe we shall hear good things of 'Mexico' yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so they did, but that is another tale.

    <h3>
      THE HEART'S REST
    </h3>
    <p>
      There is no sweeter spot in all the west Highlands of Scotland than the
      valley that runs back from that far penetrating arm of the sea, Loch Fyne,
      to Craigraven. There, after a succession of wild and gloomy glens, one
      comes upon a sweet little valley, sheltered from the east and north winds
      and open to the warm western sea and to the long sunny days of summer. It
      is a valley full of balmy airs, fragrant with the scents of sea and
      heather, and shut in from the roar and rush of the great world, just over
      the ragged rim of the craggy hills that guard it. A veritable heaven on
      earth for the nerve-racked and brain-wearied, for the heart-sick and
      soul-burdened; for it was the pleasure of the lady of Ruthven Hall, a
      kindly, homely mansion house that stood at the valley's head, to bring
      hither such of her friends or her friends' friends as needed the healing
      that soft airs and sunny days, with long quiet hours filled with love that
      understands, can give.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this spot Lady Ruthven herself had been brought, a girl fresh from the
      shelter of her English home, the bride of Sir Hector Ruthven; and here for
      five happy summers they had come from the strenuous life of Diplomatic
      Service to find rest. Here, too, came Sir Hector, when his work was done,
      still a young man, to rest under the yews in the little churchyard near
      the Hall, leaving his lady with her little daughter and her infant son to
      administer his vast estates. After the first sharp grief had passed, Lady
      Ruthven took up her burden and, with patient courage, bore it for the sake
      of the dead first, and then for the sake of the living. Round her son,
      growing into sturdy young manhood, her heart's roots wound themselves,
      striking deep into his life, till one day he, too, was laid beneath the
      yew trees in the churchyard. From that deep shadow she came forth, bearing
      her cross of service to her kind, to live a life fragrant with the airs of
      Heaven, in fellowship with Him who, for love of man, daily gave Himself to
      die.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was through her nephew, Alan Ruthven, artist and poet, pure of heart
      and clean of life, that Jack Charrington came to know Ruthven Hall and its
      dwellers. The young men first met in London, and later in Edinburgh, where
      both were pursuing their professions with a devotion that did not forbid
      attention to sundry social duties, or prevent them from taking long walks
      over the Lammermuirs on Saturday afternoons. To Ruthven Hall, Alan was
      permitted to bring his young Canadian friend, who, he was secretly
      convinced, stood sorely in need of just such benediction as his saintly
      aunt could bestow. The day of Jack Charrington's coming to Ruthven Hall
      was the birthday of his better life, when he had a vision of his
      profession in the light of that great ministry to the world's sick and
      wounded and weary by Him who came to the world &ldquo;to heal.&rdquo; In another
      sense, too, it was for him the beginning of days, for it was the day on
      which his eyes first fell upon sunny, saucy Maisie Ruthven. Thenceforth
      the orbit of Jack's life swung round Ruthven Hall, and thus it fell that
      when, on one of his visits to the great metropolis, he found Iola
      exhausted after her season's triumphs and forbidden to sing again for a
      year, and so well-nigh heart-broken, he bethought him of the little valley
      of rest in the far western Highlands. Straightway he confided to Lady
      Ruthven his concern for his co-patriot and friend, giving as much of her
      story as he thought it well that both Lady Ruthven and her daughter should
      know. Hence, when they went north to their Highland valley again, they
      carried with them Iola, to be rested and nursed, and to be healed in
      heart, too, if that could be. For Lady Ruthven, with her eyes made keen by
      grief and love, had not been long in discovering that, with Iola, the
      deeper sickness was that which no physician's medicine can reach.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the early summer they waited for signs of returning health to
      their guest, but neither the most watchful care nor the most tender
      nursing could keep the strength from gradually waning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is fretting her heart out. That's the chief cause of this terrible
      restlessness,&rdquo; said Alan Ruthven to his friend, who was visiting at the
      Hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Partly,&rdquo; replied Charrington gloomily, &ldquo;but not altogether, I fear. This
      restlessness is symptomatic. We must have Bruce Fraser out again. But if
      we only could get track of Boyle it would greatly help. She wrote
      yesterday to her great friend, Miss Robertson, who, more than anyone, has
      kept in touch with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Charrington,&rdquo; inquired Alan hesitatingly, &ldquo;would you advise that he
      should be looked up? Of course, you credit me with being perfectly
      disinterested. I gave up my dream some time ago, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, certainly, Ruthven, I know, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You fear I'm prejudiced. Well, I confess I am. I hate to think of a girl
      like that having anything to do with a man unworthy of her, as from what
      you have told me of him he must be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unworthy!&rdquo; cried Jack. &ldquo;Did I ever call him unworthy? It depends upon
      what you mean. He gambles. He has terrific passions; but he's a man
      through and through, and he's clean and honourable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Ruthven, drawing a deep breath, &ldquo;then would to Heaven she could
      find him! For this fretting is like a fever in her bones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At present, we can only wait for an answer to her letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so they waited, each one of the little group vying with the other in
      providing interest and amusement for the weary, restless, fevered girl.
      Often, at the first, the old impatience would break out, mostly in her
      talk with Charrington, at rare times to her hostess, too, but at such
      times followed by quick penitence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Lady Ruthven,&rdquo; she said one day after one of her little outbreaks,
      &ldquo;I wish I were like you. You are so sweetly good and so perfectly
      self-controlled. Even I cannot wear out your patience. You must have been
      born good and sweet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a few moments Lady Ruthven was silent, her mind going back swiftly to
      long gone years. &ldquo;No, dear,&rdquo; she said gently; &ldquo;I have much to be thankful
      for. It was a hard lesson and slowly learned, but He was patient and bore
      long with me. And He is still bearing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me how you learned,&rdquo; asked Iola timidly, and then Lady Ruthven told
      her life story, without tears, without repinings, while Iola wondered.
      That story Iola never forgot, and the influence of it never departed from
      her. Never were the days quite so bad again, but every day while she
      struggled to subdue her impatience even in thought, she kept looking for
      word from across the sea with a longing so intense that all in the house
      came to share it with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! if we only knew where to get him!&rdquo; groaned Jack Charrington to her
      one day, for to Jack, who was the only link with her happy past, she had
      opened her heart. &ldquo;Why does he keep away?&rdquo; he added bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is my fault, Jack,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;He is not to blame. No one is to
      blame but me. But he will come some day. I feel sure he will come, I only
      hope he may be in time. He would greatly grieve if&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, Iola. Don't say it. I can't bear to have you say it. You are
      getting better. Why, you walked out yesterday quite smartly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some days I am so well,&rdquo; she replied, unwilling to grieve him. &ldquo;I would
      like him to see me first on one of my good days. I am sure to hear soon
      now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had hardly turned to enter the house when they saw a messenger
      wearing the uniform of the Telegraph Department approaching.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Jack!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;there it is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Iola,&rdquo; said Jack, almost sternly, &ldquo;come in and sit down.&rdquo; So
      saying, he brought her into the library and made her recline upon the
      couch, in that sunny room near the window where many of her waking hours
      were spent.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Alan who took the message. They all followed him into the library.
      &ldquo;Shall I open it?&rdquo; he asked, with an anxious look at Iola.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said faintly, laying both hands upon her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Ruthven came to her side. &ldquo;Iola, darling,&rdquo; she said, taking both her
      hands in hers, &ldquo;it is good to feel that God's arms are about us always.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, dear Lady Ruthven,&rdquo; replied the girl, regaining her composure; &ldquo;I'm
      learning. I'm not afraid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Opening, Alan read the message, smiled, and handed it to her. She read the
      slip, handed it to Jack, closed her eyes, and, smiling, lay back upon her
      couch. &ldquo;God is good,&rdquo; she whispered, as Lady Ruthven bent over her. &ldquo;You
      were right. Teach me how to trust Him better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you all right, Iola?&rdquo; said Jack, anxiously feeling her pulse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite right, Jack, dear,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then hooray!&rdquo; cried Jack, starting up. &ldquo;Let's see, 'Coming Silurian
      seventh. Barney.'&rdquo; he read aloud. &ldquo;The seventh was yesterday. Six days.
      She'll be in on the thirteenth. Ought to be here by Monday at latest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Saturday, Jack,&rdquo; said Iola, opening her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we'll plan for Monday. We're not going to be disappointed.
      Meantime, you're not to fret.&rdquo; And he frowned sternly down upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fret?&rdquo; she cried, looking up brightly. &ldquo;Never more, Jack. I shall never
      fret again in all my life. I'm going to build up for these five days,
      every hour, every minute. I want Barney to see me well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a marvel to all the house how she kept her word. Every hour, every
      minute, she appeared to gain strength. She ate with relish and slept like
      a child. The old feverish restlessness left her, and she laid aside many
      of her invalid ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are going down to Glasgow to-morrow, I suppose, Charrington?&rdquo; said
      Alan on Thursday, after the Silurian had been reported.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've just been thinking,&rdquo; replied Jack, with careful deliberation, &ldquo;that
      it would be almost better you should go, Ruthven. You see you're the man
      of the house, and it would be easier for a stranger to tell him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Charrington,&rdquo; replied his friend, &ldquo;you don't often play the coward.
      You've simply got to go. But why should you tell?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell? He'll see it in my face. That last report of Bruce Fraser's he
      would read in my eyes. I see the ghastly words yet, 'Quite hopeless. Heart
      seriously involved. Cannot be long delayed.' I say, old man, I suppose I
      ought to go, but you've got to come along and make talk. I'll simply
      blubber right out when I see him. You know I'm awfully fond of the old
      boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, Charrington, I've got it! Take my aunt with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jack gasped. &ldquo;By Jove! The very thing! It's rough on her, but she's the
      saintly kind that delights to bear other people's burdens.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so it was arranged that Jack and Lady Ruthven should meet the boat and
      bring Barney, with all speed, to Ruthven Hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the Silurian's gangway Jack received his friend with outstretched
      hands, crying, &ldquo;Barney, old boy, we're glad to see you! Here, let me
      present you to Lady Ruthven, at whose house Iola is staying.&rdquo; With
      feverish haste he hurried Barney through the crowds, bustling hither and
      thither about his luggage and giving himself not a moment for conversation
      till they were seated in the first-class apartment carriage that was to
      carry them to Craigraven. But they had hardly got settled in their places
      when the conversation, in spite of all Jack's efforts, dropped to silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have bad news for me,&rdquo; said Barney, looking Lady Ruthven steadily in
      the face. &ldquo;Has anything happened?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Dr. Boyle,&rdquo; replied Lady Ruthven, a little more quickly than was her
      wont, &ldquo;but&mdash;&rdquo; and here she paused, shrinking from delivering the
      mortal stab, &ldquo;but we are anxious about our dear Iola.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me the worst, Lady Ruthven,&rdquo; said Barney.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is all. We are very anxious. It is her lungs chiefly and her heart.
      But she is very bright and very hopeful. It is better she should be kept
      so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barney listened with face growing grey, his eyes looking out of their deep
      sockets with the piteous, mute appeal of an animal stricken to death. He
      moistened his lips and tried to speak, but, failing, kept his eyes fixed
      on Lady Ruthven's face as if seeking relief. Charrington turned his head
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We feel thankful for her great courage,&rdquo; said Lady Ruthven, in her sweet,
      calm voice, &ldquo;and for her peace of mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At last Barney found his voice. &ldquo;Does she suspect anything?&rdquo; he asked
      hoarsely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think she must, but she has said nothing. She has been eager all summer
      to get back to her home&mdash;to you&mdash;to those she loved. She will
      rejoice to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Barney dropped his face into his hands with a low, long moan.
      Jack looked out upon the fleeting landscape dimmed by the tears he dared
      not wipe away. A long silence followed while, drop by drop, Barney drank
      his cup to the bitter dregs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We try to think of the bright side,&rdquo; at length said Lady Ruthven gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barney lifted his face from his hands, looked at her in dumb misery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is the bright side,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;the side of the immortal hope.
      We like to think of the better country. That is our real home. There,
      only, are our treasures safe.&rdquo; She was giving him time to get hold of
      himself after the first deadly stab. But Barney made no reply except to
      gravely bow. &ldquo;It is, indeed, a better country,&rdquo; she added softly as if to
      herself, &ldquo;the only place we immortals can call home.&rdquo; Then she rose.
      &ldquo;Come, Jack,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I think Dr. Boyle would like to be alone.&rdquo; Before
      she turned away to another section of the carriage, she offered him her
      hand with a grave, pitying smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barney bowed reverently over her hand. &ldquo;I am grateful to you,&rdquo; he said
      brokenly, &ldquo;believe me.&rdquo; His face was contorted with the agony that filled
      his soul. A quick rush of tears rendered her speechless and in silence
      they turned away from him, and for the long hour that followed they left
      him with his grief.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they came back they found him with face grave and steady, carrying
      the air of one who has fought his fight and has not been altogether
      beaten. And with that same steady face he reached the great door of
      Ruthven Hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jack, you will take Dr. Boyle to his room,&rdquo; said Lady Ruthven; &ldquo;I shall
      see Iola and send for him.&rdquo; But just then her daughter came down the
      stairs. &ldquo;Mamma,&rdquo; she said in a low, quick tone, &ldquo;she wants him at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, dear, I know,&rdquo; replied her mother, &ldquo;but it will be better that I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But there was a light cry, &ldquo;Barney!&rdquo; and, looking up, they all saw,
      standing at the head of the great staircase, a figure slight and frail,
      but radiant. It was Iola.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me, Lady Ruthven,&rdquo; said Barney, and was off three steps at a time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, children.&rdquo; Swiftly Lady Ruthven motioned them into the library that
      opened off the hall, where they stood gazing at each other, awed and
      silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven help them!&rdquo; at length gasped Jack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let go my arm, Dr. Charrington,&rdquo; said Miss Ruthven. &ldquo;You are hurting me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your pardon, a thousand times. I didn't know. This is more than I can
      well stand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be well to leave them for a time, Dr. Charrington,&rdquo; said Lady
      Ruthven, with a quiet dignity that subdued all emotion and recalled them
      to self-control. &ldquo;You will see that Dr. Boyle gets to his room?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall go up with you, Lady Ruthven, a little later,&rdquo; replied Jack.
      &ldquo;Yes, I confess,&rdquo; he continued, answering Miss Ruthven's look, &ldquo;I am a
      coward. I am afraid to see him. He takes things tremendously. He was quite
      mad about her years ago, fiercely mad about her, and when the break came
      it almost ruined him. How he will stand this, I don't know, but I am
      afraid to see him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This will be a terrible strain for her, Lady Ruthven,&rdquo; said Alan. &ldquo;It
      should not be prolonged, do you think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is well that they should be alone for a time,&rdquo; she replied, her own
      experience making her wise in the ways of the breaking heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      When with that quick rush Barney reached the head of the stairs Iola moved
      toward him with arms upraised. &ldquo;Barney! Barney! Have you come to me at
      last?&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      A single, searching glance into her face told him the dread truth. He took
      her gently into his arms and, restraining his passionate longing to crush
      her to him, lifted her and held her carefully, tenderly, gazing into her
      glowing, glorious eyes the while. &ldquo;Where?&rdquo; he murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This door, Barney.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He entered the little boudoir off her bedroom and laid her upon a couch he
      found there. Then, without a word, he put his cheek close to hers upon the
      pillow, murmuring over and over, &ldquo;Iola&mdash;Iola&mdash;my love&mdash;my
      love!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Barney,&rdquo; she cried, with a little happy laugh, &ldquo;don't tremble so.
      Let me look at you. See, you silly boy, I am quite strong and calm. Look
      at me, Barney,&rdquo; she pleaded, &ldquo;I am hungry to look at your face. I've only
      seen it in my dreams for so long.&rdquo; She raised herself on her arm and
      lifted his face from the pillow. &ldquo;Now let me sit up. I shall never see
      enough of you. Never! Never! Oh, how wicked and how foolish I was!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was I who was wicked,&rdquo; said Barney bitterly, &ldquo;wicked and selfish and
      cruel to you and to others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; She laid her hand on his lips. &ldquo;Sit here beside me. Now, Barney,
      don't spoil this one hour. Not one word of the past. You were a little
      hard, you know, dear, but you were right, and I knew you were right. I was
      wrong. But I thought there would be more in that other life. Even at its
      best it was spoiled. I wanted you. The great 'Lohengrin' night when they
      brought me out so many times&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was there,&rdquo; interrupted Barney, his voice still full of bitter pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know. I saw you. Oh! wasn't that a night? Didn't I sing? It was for
      you, Barney. My soul, my heart, my body, went all into Ortrud that night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a great, a truly great thing, Iola.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Iola, with a proud little laugh, &ldquo;I think the dear old
      Spectator was right when it said it was a truly great performance, but I
      waited for you, and waited and waited, and when you didn't come I found
      that all the rest was nothing to me without you. Oh, how I wanted you,
      Barney, then&mdash;and ever since!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I had only known!&rdquo; groaned Barney.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Barney, we are not to go back. We are to take all the joy out of
      this hour. Promise me, Barney, you will not blame yourself&mdash;now or
      ever&mdash;promise me, promise me!&rdquo; she cried, eagerly insistent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I do, Iola.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Barney! promise me this, we will look forward, not back, will you,
      Barney?&rdquo; The pleading in her voice swept away all feeling but the desire
      to gratify her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I promise you, Iola, and I keep my word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you do, Barney. Oh, thank you, darling.&rdquo; She wreathed her arms about
      his neck and laid her head upon his breast. &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she said with a deep
      sigh, &ldquo;I shall rest now&mdash;rest&mdash;rest. That's what I've been
      longing for. I could not rest, Barney.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barney shuddered. Only too well he knew the meaning of that fateful
      restlessness, but he only held her closer to him, his heart filled with a
      fierce refusal of his lot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no one like you, Barney, after all,&rdquo; she murmured, nestling down
      with a delicious sigh of content. &ldquo;You are so strong. You will make me
      strong, I know. I feel stronger already, stronger than for months.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Barney shuddered at that cruel deception, so characteristic of the
      treacherous disease.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don't you speak to me, Barney? You haven't said a word except just
      'Iola, Iola, Iola.' Haven't you anything else to say, sir? After your long
      silence you might&mdash;&rdquo; She raised her head and looked into his eyes
      with her old saucy smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is nothing to say, Iola. What need to speak when I can hold you
      like this? But you must not talk too much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me something about yourself,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;What? Where? How? Why? No,
      not why. I don't want that, but all the rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is hardly worth while, Iola,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;and it would take a long
      time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, think what a delicious long time. All the time there is. All the
      day and every day. Oh, Barney! does one want more Heaven than this? Tell
      me about Margaret and&mdash;yes&mdash;and Dick,&rdquo; she shyly added. &ldquo;Are
      they well and happy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, darling,&rdquo; said Barney, stroking her hair; &ldquo;just rest there and I'll
      tell you everything. But you must not exhaust yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on then, Barney,&rdquo; she replied with a sigh of ineffable bliss, nestling
      down again. &ldquo;Oh, lovely rest!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Barney told her of Margaret and Dick and of their last few days
      together, making light of Dick's injury and making much of the new joy
      that had come to them all. &ldquo;And it was your letter that did it all, Iola,&rdquo;
       he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she replied gently, &ldquo;it was our Father's goodness. I see things so
      differently, Barney. Lady Ruthven has taught me. She is an angel from
      Heaven, and, oh, what she has done for me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I, too, Iola, have great things to be thankful for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A tap came to the door and, in response to their invitation, Lady Ruthven,
      with Jack in the background, appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dinner will be served in a few minutes, Iola, and I am sure Dr. Boyle
      would like to go to his room. You can spare him, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I can't spare him, but I will if you let me go down to-night to
      dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it wise, do you think?&rdquo; said Lady Ruthven gravely. &ldquo;You must save your
      strength now, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but I am strong. Just for to-night,&rdquo; she pleaded. &ldquo;I'm not going to
      be an invalid to-night. I'm going to forget all about it. I am going to
      eat a good dinner and I'm going to sing, too. Jack, tell them I can go
      down. Barney, you will take me down. You may carry me, if you like. I am
      going, Jack,&rdquo; she continued with something of her old imperious air.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barney searched her face with a critical glance, holding his fingers upon
      her wrist. She was growing excited. &ldquo;Well, I think she might go down for a
      little. What do you think, Charrington? You know best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If she is good she might,&rdquo; said Jack doubtfully. &ldquo;But she must promise to
      be quiet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jack, you're a dear. You're an angel. I'll be good&mdash;as good as I
      can.&rdquo; With which extremely doubtful promise they had to content
      themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      At dinner none was more radiant that Iola. Without effort or strain her
      wit and gaiety bubbled over, till Barney, watching her in wonder, asked
      himself whether in his first impression of her he had not been mistaken.
      As he still watched and listened his wonder grew. How brilliantly clever
      she was! How quick her wit! How exquisitely subtle her fancy! Her mind,
      glowing like a live coal, seemed to kindle by mere contact the minds about
      her, till the whole table, catching her fire, scintillated with
      imagination's divine flame. Through it all Barney became conscious of a
      change in her. She was brighter than of old, cleverer by far. Her
      conversation was that of a highly cultured woman of the world. But it was
      not these that made the change. There was a new quality of soul in her.
      Patience had wrought her perfect work. She exhaled that exquisite aroma of
      the spirit disciplined by pain. She was less of the earth, earthy. The
      airs of Heaven were breathing about her.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Barney, with his new sensitiveness to the spiritual, this change in
      Iola made her inexpressibly dear. It seemed as if he had met her in a new
      and better country where neither had seen the other before. And yet it
      filled him with an odd sense of loss. It was as if earth were losing its
      claim in her, as if her earthward affinities were refining into the
      heavenly. She was keenly interested in the story of Dick's work and, in
      spite of his reluctance to talk, she so managed the conversation, that,
      before he was aware, Barney was in the full tide of the thrilling tale of
      his brother's heroic service to the men in the mountains of Western
      Canada. As Barney waxed eloquent, picturing the perils and privations, the
      discouragements and defeats, the toils and triumphs of missionary life,
      the lustrous eyes grew luminous with deep inner light, the beautiful face,
      its ivory pallor relieved by a touch of carmine upon lip and cheek,
      appeared to shed a very radiance of glory that drew and held the gaze of
      the whole company.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, what splendid work!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;How good to be a man! But it's
      better,&rdquo; she added, with a quick glance at Barney and a little shy laugh,
      &ldquo;to be a woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the anxiety in Charrington's eyes that arrested Lady Ruthven's
      attention and made her bring the dinner somewhat abruptly to a close.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Lady Ruthven, must we go?&rdquo; cried Iola, as her hostess made a move to
      rise. &ldquo;What a delightful dinner we have had! Now you are not going to send
      me away just yet. 'After dinner sit a while,' you know, and I believe I
      feel like singing to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, my dear,&rdquo; said Lady Ruthven, &ldquo;do you think you should exert
      yourself any more? You have had an exciting day. What does your doctor
      say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Barney?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Barney, indeed!&rdquo; echoed Jack indignantly. &ldquo;Oh, the ingratitude of the
      female heart! Here for all these weeks I have&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me, Jack. I am quite sure you won't be hard-hearted enough to
      banish me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An hour on the library couch, whence one can look upon the sea, in an
      atmosphere of restful quiet, listening to cheerful but not too exciting
      conversation,&rdquo; said Jack gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And music, Doctor?&rdquo; inquired Iola, with mock humility.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'll sing a little myself,&rdquo; replied Jack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my dear Iola,&rdquo; cried Miss Ruthven, &ldquo;hasten to bed, I beg of you, and
      save us all. And yet, do you know, I rather like to hear Dr. Charrington
      sing. It makes me think of our automobile tour in the Highlands last
      year,&rdquo; she continued with mischievous gravity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Jack, much flattered, &ldquo;I don't quite&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the horn, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wretch! Now I refuse outright to sing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really? And after we had prepared ourselves for the&mdash;ah&mdash;experience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you feel now, Iola?&rdquo; said Jack, quietly placing his fingers upon
      her pulse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly strong, I assure you. Listen.&rdquo; And she ran up her chromatics in
      a voice rich and strong and clear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, this is most wonderful!&rdquo; exclaimed Jack. &ldquo;Her pulse is strong,
      even, steady. Her respiration is normal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you!&rdquo; cried Iola triumphantly. &ldquo;Now you will let me sing&mdash;not
      a big song, but just that wee Scotch thing I learned from old Jennie.
      Barney's mother used to sing it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Iola,&rdquo; entreated Lady Ruthven, &ldquo;do you think you should venture?
      Do you think she should, Dr. Boyle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't ask me,&rdquo; said Barney. &ldquo;I should forbid it were it anyone else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it isn't anyone else,&rdquo; persisted Iola, &ldquo;and my doctor says yes. I'll
      only hum, Jack.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, one only. And mind, no fugues, arpeggios, double-stoppings, and
      such frills.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She took her guitar. &ldquo;I'll sing this for Barney's dear mother,&rdquo; she said.
      And in a voice soft, rich and full of melody, and with perfect
      reproduction of the quaint old-fashioned cadences and quavers, she sang
      the Highland lament, &ldquo;O'er the Moor.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;O'er the moor I wander lonely,
      Ochon-a-rie, my heart is sore;
      Where are all the joys I cherished?
      With my darling they have perished,
      And they will return no more.

     &ldquo;I loved thee first, I loved thee only,
      Ochon-a-rie, my heart is sore;
      I loved thee from the day I met thee.
      What care I though all forget thee?
      I will love thee evermore.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      And then, before anyone could utter a word of protest, she said, &ldquo;You
      never heard this, I think, Barney. I'll sing it for you.&rdquo; And in a low,
      soft voice, thrilling with pathetic feeling, she sang the quaint little
      song that described so fittingly her own experience, &ldquo;My Heart's Rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;I had wandered far, and the wind was cold,
      And the sharp thorns clutched, and the day was old,
      When the Master came to close His fold
               And saw that one had strayed.

     &ldquo;Wild paths I fled, and the wind grew chill,
      And the sharp rocks cut, and the day waned, till
      The Master's voice searched vale and hill:
               I heard and fled afraid.

     &ldquo;Dread steeps I climbed, and the wind wailed on.
      And the stars went out, and the day was gone,
      Then the Master found, laid me upon
               His bosom, unafraid.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      A hush followed upon her song. Far down the valley the moon rose red out
      of the sea, the sweet night air, breathing its fragrance of mignonette and
      roses, moved the lace of the curtains at the open window as it passed. A
      late thrush was singing its night song of love to its mate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel as if I could sleep now,&rdquo; said Iola. &ldquo;Barney, carry me.&rdquo; Like a
      tired child she nestled down in Barney's strong arms. &ldquo;Good-night, dear
      friends, all,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;What a happy evening it has been.&rdquo; Then, with a
      little cry, &ldquo;Oh, Barney! hold me. I'm slipping,&rdquo; she locked her arms tight
      about his neck, lifting her face to his. &ldquo;Goodnight, Barney, my love, my
      own love,&rdquo; she whispered, her breath coming in gasps. &ldquo;How good you are to
      me&mdash;how good to have you. Now kiss me&mdash;quick&mdash;don't wait&mdash;again,
      dear&mdash;good-night.&rdquo; Her arms slipped down from his neck. Her head sank
      upon his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Iola!&rdquo; he cried, in a voice strident with fear and alarm, glancing down
      into her face. He carried her to the open window. &ldquo;Oh, my God! My God! She
      is gone! Oh, my love, not yet! not yet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the ear was dull even to that penetrating cry of the broken heart, and
      the singing voice was forever still from words or songs that mortal ears
      could hear. In vain they tried to revive her. The tired lids rested upon
      the lustrous eyes from which all light had fled. The weary heart was quiet
      at last. Gently, Barney placed her on the couch, where she lay as if
      asleep, then, standing upright, he gazed round upon them with eyes full of
      dumb anguish till they understood, and one by one they turned and left him
      alone with his dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      For two days Barney wandered about the valley, his spirit moving in the
      midst of a solemn and mysterious peace. The light of life for him had not
      gone out, but had brightened into the greater glory. Heaven had not
      snatched her away. She had brought Heaven near.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first he was minded to carry her back with him to the old home and lay
      her in the churchyard there. But Lady Ruthven took him to the spot where
      her dead lay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We should be glad that she should sleep beside our dear ones here,&rdquo; she
      said. &ldquo;You know we love her dearly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a great kindness you are doing, Lady Ruthven,&rdquo; Barney replied, his
      heart responding with glad acceptance to the suggestion. &ldquo;She loved this
      valley, and it was here she first found rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, she loves this valley,&rdquo; replied Lady Ruthven, refusing to accept
      Barney's tense. To her, death made no change. &ldquo;And here she found peace
      and perfect love again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A single line in the daily press brought a few close friends from London
      to bury her. Old Sir Walter himself was present. He had taken such pride
      in her voice, and had learned to love his pupil as a daughter, and with
      him stood Herr Lindau, the German impresario, under whose management she
      had made her London debut in &ldquo;Lohengrin.&rdquo; There in the sunny valley they
      laid her down, their faces touched with smiles that struggled with their
      tears. But on his face who loved her best of all there were no tears, only
      a look of wonder, and of gladness, and of peace.

    <h3>
      THE LAST CALL
    </h3>
    <p>
      Dick was discouraged and, a rare thing with him, his face showed his
      discouragement. In the war against the saloon and vice in its various
      forms he felt that he stood almost alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the door of The Clarion office the editor, Lemuel Daggett, hailed him.
      He hesitated a moment, then entered. A newspaper office was familiar
      territory to him, as was also that back country that stretches to the
      horizon from the back door of every printing office. The Clarion was the
      organ of the political Outs as The Pioneer was that of the Ins. Politics
      in British Columbia had not yet arrived at that stage of development
      wherein parties differentiate themselves from each other upon great
      principles. The Ins were in and the Outs opposed them chiefly on that
      ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Daggett, with an air of gentle patronage, &ldquo;how did the
      meeting go last night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't suppose you need to ask. I saw you there. It didn't go at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Daggett, &ldquo;your men are all right in their opinions, but
      they never allow their opinions to interfere with business. I could have
      told you every last man of them was scared. There's Matheson, couldn't
      stand up against his wholesale grocer. Religion mustn't interfere with
      sales. The saloons and 'red lights' pay cash; therefore, quit your
      nonsense and stick to business. Hutton sells more drugs and perfumes to
      the 'red lights' than to all the rest of the town and country put
      together. Goring's chief won't stand any monkeying with politics. Leave
      things as they are. Why, even the ladies decline to imperil their
      husbands' business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dick swallowed the bitter pill without a wink. He was down, but he was not
      yet completely out. Only too well he knew the truth of Daggett's review of
      the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is something in what you say,&rdquo; he conceded, &ldquo;but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, come now,&rdquo; interrupted Daggett, &ldquo;you know better than that. This town
      and this country is run by the whiskey ring. Why, there's Hickey, he
      daren't arrest saloonkeeper or gambler, though he hates whiskey and the
      whole outfit worse than poison. Why doesn't he? The Honourable McKenty, M.
      P., drops him a hint. Hickey is told to mind his own business and leave
      the saloon and the 'red lights' alone, and so poor Hickey is sitting down
      trying to discover what his business is ever since. The safe thing is to
      do nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem to know all about it,&rdquo; said Dick. &ldquo;What's the good of your
      paper? Why don't you get after these men?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear sir, are you an old newspaper man, and ask that? It is quite true
      that The Clarion is the champion of liberty, the great moulder of public
      opinion, the leader in all moral reform, but unhappily, not being an
      endowed institution, it is forced to consider advertising space.
      Advertising, circulation, subscriptions, these are the considerations that
      determine newspaper policy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dick gazed ruefully out of the window. &ldquo;It's true. It's terribly true,&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;The people don't want anything better than they have. The saloon
      must continue to be the dominant influence here for a time. But you hear
      me, Daggett, a better day is coming, and if you want an opportunity to do,
      not the heroic thing only, but the wise thing, jump into a campaign for
      reform. Do you think Canadians are going to stand this long? This is a
      Christian country, I tell you. The Church will take a hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daggett smiled a superior smile. &ldquo;Coming? Yes, sure, but meantime The
      Pioneer spells Church with a small c, and even the Almighty's name with a
      small g.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you, Daggett,&rdquo; said Dick hotly, &ldquo;The Pioneer's day is past. I see
      signs and I hear rumblings of a storm that will sweep it, and you, too,
      unless you change, out of existence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all, my dear sir. We will be riding on that storm when it arrives.
      But the rumblings are somewhat distant. I, too, see signs, but the time is
      not yet. By the way, where is your brother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't see much of him. He is up and down the line, busy with his sick
      and running this library and clubroom business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Daggett thoughtfully, &ldquo;I hear of him often. The railroad
      men and the lumbermen grovel to him. Look here, would he run in this
      constituency?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dick laughed at him. &ldquo;Not he. Why, man, he's straight. You couldn't buy
      him. Oh, I know the game.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daggett was silenced for some moments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; said Daggett, looking out of the window, &ldquo;here is our coming
      Member.&rdquo; He opened the door. &ldquo;Mr. Hull, let me introduce you to the
      Reverend Richard Boyle, preacher and moral reformer. Mr. Boyle&mdash;Mr.
      Hull, the coming Member for this constituency.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope he will make a better fist of it than the present incumbent,&rdquo; said
      Dick a little gruffly, for he had little respect for either of the
      political parties or their representatives. &ldquo;I must get along. But,
      Daggett, for goodness' sake do something with this beastly gambling-hell
      business.&rdquo; With this he closed the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good fellow, Boyle, I reckon,&rdquo; said Hull, &ldquo;but a little unpractical, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; agreed Daggett, &ldquo;he is somewhat visionary. But I begin to think he
      is on the right track.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How? What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean the West is beginning to lose its wool, and it's time this country
      was getting civilized. That fool editor of The Pioneer thinks that because
      he keeps wearing buckskin pants and a cowboy hat, he can keep back the
      wheels of time. He hasn't brains enough to last him over night. Boyle says
      he sees the signs of a coming storm. I believe I see them, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Signs?&rdquo; inquired Hull.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, the East is taking notice. The big corporations are being held
      responsible for their men, their health, and their morals. 'Mexico,' too,
      has something up his sleeve. He's acting queer, and this Boyle's brother
      is taking a hand, I believe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The doctor, eh? Pshaw! let him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You get next him quick. He's the coming man in this country, don't forget
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hull grunted rather contemptuously. He himself was a man of considerable
      wealth. He was an old timer and cherished the old timer's contempt for the
      tenderfoot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Daggett, &ldquo;you may sniff. I've watched him and I've
      discovered this, that what he wants to do he does. He's an old poker
      player. He has cleaned out 'Mexico' half a dozen times. He has quit poker
      now, they say, and he's got 'Mexico' going queer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's his game?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't make it out quite. He has turned religious, they say. Spoke here at
      a big meeting last spring, quite dramatic, I believe. I wasn't there.
      Offered to pay back his ungodly winnings. Of course, no man would listen
      to that, so he's putting libraries into the camps and establishing
      clubrooms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove! it's a good game. But what do the boys, what does 'Mexico' think
      of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, that's the strangest part of it. He's got them going his way. He's a
      doctor, you know, has nursed a lot of them, and they swear by him. He's a
      sign, I tell you. So is 'Mexico.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about 'Mexico'?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you know 'Mexico' has been the head centre of the saloon outfit,
      divides the spoil and collects the 'rents.' But I say he's acting queer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hull was at once on the alert. &ldquo;That's interesting. You are sure of your
      facts? It might be all right to corral those chaps. The virtue campaign is
      bound to come. A little premature yet, but that doctor fellow is to be
      considered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the virtue campaign did not immediately begin. The whole political
      machinery of both parties was too completely under the control of the
      saloon and &ldquo;red light&rdquo; influence to be easily emancipated. The business
      interests of the little towns along the line were so largely dependent
      upon the support of the saloon and the patronage of vice that few had the
      courage to openly espouse and seriously champion a campaign for reform.
      And while many, perhaps the majority, of the men employed in the railroad
      and in the lumber camps, though they were subject to periodic lapses from
      the path of sobriety and virtue, were really opposed to the saloon and its
      allies, yet they lacked leadership and were, therefore, unreliable. It was
      at this point that the machine in each party began to cherish a nervous
      apprehension in regard to the influence of Dr. Boyle. Bitter enemies
      though they were, they united their forces in an endeavour to have the
      doctor removed. The wires ordinarily effective were pulled with
      considerable success, when the manipulators met with an unexpected
      obstacle in General Manager Fahey. Upon him the full force of the combined
      influences available was turned, but to no purpose. He was too good a
      railway manager to be willing to lose the services of a man &ldquo;who knew his
      work and did it right, a man who couldn't be bullied or blocked, and a
      man, bedad, who could play a good game of poker.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He stays while I stay,&rdquo; was Fahey's last word in reply to an influential
      director, labouring in the interests of the party machine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Failing with Fahey, the allied forces tried another line of attack.
      &ldquo;Mexico&rdquo; and the organization of which he was the head were instructed to
      &ldquo;run him out.&rdquo; Receiving his orders, &ldquo;Mexico&rdquo; called his agents together
      and invited their opinions. A sharp cleavage immediately developed, one
      party led by &ldquo;Peachy&rdquo; being strongly in favour of obeying the orders, the
      other party, leaderless and scattering, strongly opposed. Discussion waxed
      bitter. &ldquo;Mexico&rdquo; sat silent, watchful, impassive. At length, &ldquo;Peachy,&rdquo; in
      full swing of an impassioned and sulphurous denunciation of the doctor,
      his person and his ways, was called abruptly to order by a peremptory word
      from his chief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shut up your fool head, 'Peachy.' To hear you talk you'd think you'd do
      something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A grim laugh at &ldquo;Peachy's&rdquo; expense went round the company.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do somethin'?&rdquo; snarled &ldquo;Peachy,&rdquo; stung to fury, &ldquo;I'll do somethin' one of
      these days. I've stood you all I want.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peachy's&rdquo; oaths were crude in comparison with &ldquo;Mexico's,&rdquo; but his fury
      lent them force. &ldquo;Mexico&rdquo; turned his baleful, gleaming eyes upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do something? Meaning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; growled &ldquo;Peachy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Git!&rdquo; &ldquo;Mexico&rdquo; pointed a long finger to the door. It was a word of doom,
      and they all knew it, for it meant not simply dismissal from that meeting,
      but banishment from the company of which &ldquo;Mexico&rdquo; was head, and that meant
      banishment from the line of the Crow's Nest Pass. &ldquo;Peachy&rdquo; was startled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn't be so blanked swift,&rdquo; he growled apologetically. &ldquo;I didn't
      mean for to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You git!&rdquo; repeated &ldquo;Mexico,&rdquo; turning the pointing finger from the door to
      the face of the startled wretch.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a fierce oath &ldquo;Peachy&rdquo; reached for his gun, but hesitated to draw.
      &ldquo;Mexico&rdquo; moved not a line of his face, not a muscle of his body, except
      that his head went a little back and the heavy eyelids fell somewhat over
      the piercing black eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You dog!&rdquo; he ground out through his clenched teeth, &ldquo;you know you can't
      bring out your gun. I know you. You poor cur! You thought you'd sell me up
      to the other side! I know your scheme! Now git, and quick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The command came sharp like a snap of an animal's teeth, while &ldquo;Mexico's&rdquo;
       hand dropped swiftly to his side. Instantly &ldquo;Peachy&rdquo; rose and backed
      slowly toward the door, his face wearing the grin of a savage beast. At
      the door he paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Mexico,'&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is this the last between you and me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mexico&rdquo; kept his gleaming eyes fastened upon the face of the man backing
      out of the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Git out, you cur!&rdquo; he said, with contemptuous deliberation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take that, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Like a flash, &ldquo;Mexico&rdquo; threw himself to one side. Two shots rang out as
      one. A slight smile curled &ldquo;Mexico's&rdquo; lip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Got him that time, I reckon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hurt, 'Mexico'?&rdquo; anxiously inquired his friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naw. He ain't got the nerve to shoot straight.&rdquo; The bartender and some
      others came running in with anxious faces. &ldquo;Never mind, boys,&rdquo; said
      &ldquo;Mexico.&rdquo; &ldquo;'Peachy' was foolin' with his gun; it went off and hurt him
      some.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, there's blood here!&rdquo; said the bartender. &ldquo;He's been bleedin' bad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guess he's more scared than hurt. Now let's git to business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The bartender and his friends took the hint and retired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, boys, listen to me,&rdquo; said &ldquo;Mexico&rdquo; impressively, leaning over the
      table. &ldquo;Right here I want to say that the doctor is a friend of mine, and
      the man that touches him touches me.&rdquo; There was an ominous silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just as you say, 'Mexico,'&rdquo; said one of the men, &ldquo;but I see the finish of
      our game in these parts. The doctor's got the boys a-goin' and you know he
      ain't the kind that quits.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're right an' you're wrong. The Doc ain't the whole Government of this
      country yet. His game's the winnin' game. Any fool can see that. But we
      hold most of the trumps just now. So for the present we stay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the meeting broke up, &ldquo;Mexico's&rdquo; friends warned him against &ldquo;Peachy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pshaw! 'Peachy'!&rdquo; said &ldquo;Mexico&rdquo; contemptuously. &ldquo;He couldn't hold his gun
      steady at me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's all right behind a tree, though, an' there's lots of 'em round.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But &ldquo;Mexico&rdquo; only spat out his contempt for anything that &ldquo;Peachy&rdquo; could
      do, and went calmly on his way, &ldquo;keeping the boys in line.&rdquo; But he began
      to be painfully conscious of an undercurrent of feeling over which he
      could exercise no control. Not that there was any lack of readiness on the
      part of the boys to &ldquo;line up&rdquo; at the word, but there was no corresponding
      readiness in pledging their support to the &ldquo;same old party.&rdquo; There was, on
      the contrary, a very marked reserve on the part of the men who formerly,
      especially after the lining up process had been several times repeated,
      had been distinguished for unlimited enthusiasm for all &ldquo;Mexico&rdquo;
       represented. They &ldquo;lined up&rdquo; still, but beyond this they did not go.
    </p>
    <p>
      The editor of The Pioneer, too, became conscious of this change in the
      attitude of the men he had always counted upon to do his bidding at the
      polls. &ldquo;It's that cursed doctor!&rdquo; he exclaimed to McKenty, the Member for
      the district. &ldquo;He's been working a deep game. Of course, his brother's
      putting up all kinds of a fight, but we expect that and we know how to
      handle him. But this fellow is different. I tell you I'm afraid of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pshaw! He hasn't got any backing,&rdquo; said McKenty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he hasn't got any grease, and you can't make anything go without
      grease.&rdquo; McKenty spoke out of considerable experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's all right as an ordinary thing, but the doctor has grease of
      another kind. This library and clubroom business is catching the boys all
      round.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've heard about it,&rdquo; said McKenty. &ldquo;I guess the Government could take a
      hand in libraries and institutes and that sort of thing, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's all right,&rdquo; replied the editor. &ldquo;Might do some good. But you can't
      beat him at that game. It isn't his libraries and his clubs altogether or
      chiefly, it's himself and his work. He's a number one doctor, and night
      and day he's on the road. By Jove! he's everywhere. He's got no end of
      stay, confound him! I tell you he's a winner. He can get a thousand men in
      a week to back him for anything he says.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      McKenty thought deeply for some moments. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, finally,
      &ldquo;something has got to be done. We can't afford, you and I, at this stage
      to get out of the game. What about 'Mexico'?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Mexico'!&rdquo; exclaimed the editor, breaking out into profanity. &ldquo;There's
      the weakest spot in the whole combination, just where it used to be
      strongest. The doctor's got him, body and soul. Why, 'Mexico' 'd be after
      him with a gun if he stayed anywhere else when he visits town. The best in
      'Mexico's' saloon isn't quite good enough for the doctor. No, sir! He's
      got a line on 'Mexico,' all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't you shake him loose? There are the usual ways, you know, of
      loosening up people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my dear sir, I'm just telling you that the usual ways won't work
      here. This combination is something quite unusual. I believe there's some
      religion in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      McKenty laughed loud. It was a good joke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you I mean it,&rdquo; said the editor, testily. &ldquo;The doctor's got it
      hard. Talk about conversion! You weren't at that meeting last spring&mdash;I
      was&mdash;when he got up and preached us a sermon that would make your
      hair curl.&rdquo; And the editor proceeded to give a graphic account of the
      meeting in question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said McKenty, &ldquo;I guess we can't touch the doctor. But 'Mexico,'
      pshaw! we can keep 'Mexico' solid. We've got to. He knows too much. You've
      simply got to get after him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This the editor of The Pioneer proceeded to do without delay, for, looking
      out through the dusty windows of The Pioneer office, he perceived &ldquo;Mexico&rdquo;
       sauntering down the other side of the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There he is now,&rdquo; he cried, going toward the door. &ldquo;Hi! 'Mexico'!&rdquo; he
      called, and &ldquo;Mexico&rdquo; came slouching across. &ldquo;Ugly looking beggar, ain't
      he?&rdquo; said the editor. &ldquo;Jaw like a bulldog. Morning, 'Mexico'!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mornin',&rdquo; grunted &ldquo;Mexico,&rdquo; nodding first to the editor and then to
      McKenty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is things, 'Mexico'?&rdquo; said the editor, in his most ingratiating
      manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are the boys? Vote solid? Election's coming on, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Comin' on soon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it looks that way, but really one can't say. We ought to be ready,
      though.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't be too soon,&rdquo; said &ldquo;Mexico.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Time's agin ye. Leather pants goin' out of fashion,&rdquo; with a glance at the
      schapps which the editor delighted to wear. &ldquo;People beginnin' to go to
      meetin' in this country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hear you're going yourself a little, 'Mexico,'&rdquo; said McKenty,
      facetiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mexico&rdquo; turned his eyes slowly upon the Member.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything to say agin it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all, 'Mexico,' not at all. Good thing; but they say the doctor's
      got the boys rather away from you, that you're losing your grip.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who says?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I hear it everywhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guess it must be right, then,&rdquo; replied &ldquo;Mexico,&rdquo; grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And they say he's got a line on you, 'Mexico,' getting you right up to
      the mourners' bench.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, 'Mexico,'&rdquo; said McKenty, dropping his bantering tone, &ldquo;you're
      not going to let the blank preacher-doctor combination work you, are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't know about that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. But I do know that there ain't any other combination kin. I'm working
      for myself in this game. If any combination wants to shove my way, they
      can jump in. They'll quit when it don't pay to shove, I guess. Me the
      same. You fellers ain't any interest in me, I reckon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, do you imagine the doctor has?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mexico&rdquo; paused, then said thoughtfully, &ldquo;Blanked if I can git on to his
      game!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, come, 'Mexico,' you can't get on to him? He's working you. You don't
      really think he has your interest at heart?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't quite tell.&rdquo; &ldquo;Mexico&rdquo; wore a vexed and thoughtful air. &ldquo;Wish I
      could. If I thought so I'd&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tie up to him tight, you bet your eternal life!&rdquo; There was a sudden gleam
      from under &ldquo;Mexico's&rdquo; heavy brows and a ring in his usually drawling
      voice, that sufficiently attested his earnestness. &ldquo;There ain't too many
      of that kind raound.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think of that?&rdquo; inquired the editor, as &ldquo;Mexico&rdquo; sauntered
      out of the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think? I think there's a law against gamblers in this province and it
      ought to be enforced.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That means war,&rdquo; said the editor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, let it come. That doctor is the whole trouble, I can see. I'd give
      a thousand dollars down to see him out of the country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But there was no sign that the doctor had any desire to leave the country,
      and all who knew him were quite certain that until he should so desire,
      leave he would not. All through the winter he went about his work with a
      devotion that taxed even his superb physical strength to the uttermost. In
      addition to his work as Medical Superintendent of the railroad he had been
      asked to take oversight of the new coal mines opening up here and there in
      the Pass, which brought him no end of both labour and trouble. The
      managers of the mines held the most primitive ideas in regard to both
      safety in operating a mine and sanitation of miners' quarters.
      Consequently, the doctor had to enter upon a long campaign of education.
      It was an almost hopeless task. The directors were remote from the ground
      and were unimpressed by the needs so urgently reported by their doctor.
      The managers on the ground were concerned chiefly with keeping down the
      expenses of operation. The miners themselves were, as a class, too well
      accustomed to the wretched conditions under which they lived and worked to
      make any strenuous objection.
    </p>
    <p>
      How to bring about a better condition of things became, with the doctor, a
      constant subject of thought. It was also the theme of conversation on the
      occasion of his monthly visits to the Kuskinook Hospital, where it had
      become an established custom for Dick and him to meet since his return
      from Scotland.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll get them to listen when we kill a few score men, not before,&rdquo;
       grumbled Barney to Dick and Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's the universal law,&rdquo; replied Dick. &ldquo;Some men must die for their
      nation. It's been the way from the first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Barney, is it wise that you should worry yourself and work yourself
      to death as you are doing?&rdquo; said Margaret, anxiously. &ldquo;You know you can't
      stand this long. You are not the man you were when you came back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barney only smiled. &ldquo;That would be no great matter,&rdquo; he said, lightly.
      &ldquo;But there is no fear of me,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;I don't pine for an early death,
      you know. I've got a lot to live for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was silence for a minute or two. They were thinking of the grave in
      the little churchyard across the sea. Ever since Barney's return, and as
      often as they met together, they allowed themselves to think and speak
      freely of the little valley at Craigraven, so full of light and peace,
      with its grave beside the little church. At first Dick and Margaret shrank
      from all reference to Iola, and sought to turn Barney's mind from thoughts
      so full of pain. But Barney would not have it so. Frankly and simply he
      began to speak of her, dwelling lovingly and tenderly upon all the details
      of the last days of her life, as he had gathered them from Lady Ruthven,
      her friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be easier for me not to speak of her,&rdquo; he had said on his
      return, &ldquo;but I've lost too much to risk the loss of more. I want you to
      talk of her, and by and by I shall find it easy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And this they did most loyally, and with tender solicitude for him, till
      at length the habit grew, so that whenever they came together it only
      deepened and chastened their joy in each other to keep fresh the memory of
      her who had filled so large a place, and so vividly, in the life of each
      of them. And this was good for them all, but especially for Barney. It
      took the bitterness out of his grief, and much of the pain out of his
      loss. The memory of that last evening with Iola, and Lady Ruthven's story
      of the purifying of her spirit, during those last few months, combined to
      throw about her a radiance such as she had never shed even in the most
      radiant moments of her life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is only place for gratitude,&rdquo; he said, one evening, to them. &ldquo;Why
      should I allow any mean or selfish thought to spoil my memory of her or to
      hinder the gratitude I ought to feel, that her going was so free from
      pain, and her last evening so full of joy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was with these feelings in his heart that he went back to the camps to
      his work among the sick and wounded in body and in heart. And as he went
      in and out among the men they became conscious of a new spirit in him. His
      touch on the knife was as sure as ever, his nerve as steady, but while the
      old reserve still held his lips from overflowing, the words that dropped
      were kinder, the tone gentler, the touch more tender. The terrible
      restlessness, too, was gone out of his blood. A great calm possessed him.
      He was always ready for the ultimate demand, prepared to give of his life
      to the uttermost. To his former care for the physical well-being of the
      men, he added now a concern for their mental and spiritual good, and hence
      the system of libraries and clubrooms he had initiated throughout the
      camps and towns along the line. It mattered not to him that he had to meet
      the open opposition of the saloon element and the secret hostility of
      those who depended upon that element for the success of their political
      schemes. His love of a fight was as strong as ever. At first the men could
      not fathom his motives, but as men do, they silently and observantly
      waited for the real motive to emerge. As &ldquo;Mexico&rdquo; said, they &ldquo;couldn't get
      onto his game.&rdquo; And none of them was more completely puzzled than was
      &ldquo;Mexico&rdquo; himself, but none more fully acknowledged, and more frankly
      yielded to the fascination of the new spirit and new manner which the
      doctor brought to his work. At the same time, however, &ldquo;Mexico&rdquo; could not
      rid himself of a suspicion, now and then, that the real game was being
      kept dark. The day was to come when &ldquo;Mexico&rdquo; would cast away every vestige
      of suspicion and give himself up to the full luxury of devotion to a man,
      worthy to be followed, who lived not for his own things. But that day was
      not yet, and &ldquo;Mexico&rdquo; was kept in a state of uncertainty most disturbing
      to his mind and injurious to his temper. Day by day reports came of the
      doctor's ceaseless toil and unvarying self-sacrifice, the very magnitude
      of which made it difficult for &ldquo;Mexico&rdquo; to accept it as being sincere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's his game?&rdquo; he kept asking himself more savagely, as the mystery
      deepened. &ldquo;What's in it for him? Is he after McKenty's job?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One night the doctor came in from a horseback trip to a tie camp twelve
      miles up the valley, wearied and soaked with the wet snow that had been
      falling heavily all day. &ldquo;Mexico&rdquo; received him with a wrathful affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the&mdash;ah&mdash;what makes you go out a night like this?&rdquo;
       &ldquo;Mexico&rdquo; asked him with indignation, struggling to check his profanity,
      which he had come to notice the doctor disliked. &ldquo;I can't get onto you.
      It's all just d&mdash;, that is, cursed foolishness!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, 'Mexico,' wait till I get these wet things off and I'll tell
      you. Now listen,&rdquo; said the doctor, when he sat warm and dry before
      &ldquo;Mexico's&rdquo; fire. &ldquo;I've been wanting to tell you this for some time.&rdquo; He
      opened his black bag and took out a New Testament which now always formed
      a part of his equipment, and finding the place, read the story of the two
      debtors. &ldquo;Do you remember, 'Mexico,' the talk I gave you last spring?&rdquo;
       &ldquo;Mexico&rdquo; nodded. That talk he would not soon forget. &ldquo;I had a big debt on
      then. It was forgiven me. He did a lot for me that time, and since then He
      has piled it up till I feel as if I couldn't live long enough to pay back
      what I owe.&rdquo; Then he told &ldquo;Mexico&rdquo; in a low, reverent tone, with shining
      eyes and thrilling voice, the story of Iola's going. &ldquo;That's why,&rdquo; he
      said, when he concluded his tale. &ldquo;That was a great thing He did for her
      and for me. And then, 'Mexico,' these poor chaps! they have so little. Who
      cares for them? That's why I go out on a night like this. And don't you
      think that's good enough?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then &ldquo;Mexico&rdquo; turned himself loose for five minutes and let off the
      sulphurous emotion that had been collecting during the doctor's tale.
      After he had become coherent again he said with slow emphasis:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've got me, Doc. Wipe your feet on me when you want.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Mexico,'&rdquo; replied the doctor, &ldquo;you know I don't preach at you. I
      haven't, have I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blanked if&mdash;that is, no, you haven't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you say I can have you. I'll take you right here. You are my
      friend.&rdquo; He put out his hand, which &ldquo;Mexico&rdquo; gripped and held fast. &ldquo;But,&rdquo;
       continued the doctor, &ldquo;I want to say that He wants you more than I do,
      wants to wipe off that debt of yours, wants you for His friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, Doc,&rdquo; said &ldquo;Mexico,&rdquo; drawing back a little from him, &ldquo;I guess not.
      That there debt goes back for twenty years, and it's piled out of sight.
      It never bothers me much except when I see you and hear you talk. It would
      be a blank&mdash;that is, a pretty fine thing to have it cleaned off. But
      say, Doc, your heap agin mine would be like a sandhill agin that mountain
      there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The size makes no difference to Him, 'Mexico,'&rdquo; said the doctor, quietly.
      &ldquo;He is great enough to wipe out anything. I tell you, 'Mexico,' it's good
      to get it wiped off. It's simply great!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're right there,&rdquo; said &ldquo;Mexico,&rdquo; emphatically. Then, as if a sudden
      suspicion flashed in upon him, &ldquo;Say, you're not talkin' religion to me,
      are you? I ain't goin' to die just yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Religion? Call it anything you like, 'Mexico.' All I know is I've got a
      good thing and I want my friend to have it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the doctor was departing next morning &ldquo;Mexico&rdquo; stopped him at the
      door. &ldquo;I say, Doc, would you mind letting me have that there book of yours
      for a spell?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor took it out of his bag. &ldquo;It's yours, 'Mexico,' and you can bank
      on it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The book proved of absorbing interest to &ldquo;Mexico.&rdquo; He read it openly in
      the saloon without any sense of incongruity, at first, between the book
      and the business he was carrying on, but not without very considerable
      comment on the part of his customers and friends. And what he read became
      the subject of frequent discussions with his friend, the doctor. The book
      did its work with &ldquo;Mexico,&rdquo; as it does with all who give it place, and the
      first sign of its influence was an uncomfortable feeling in &ldquo;Mexico's&rdquo;
       mind in regard to his business and his habits of life. His discomfort
      became acute one pay night, after a very successful game of poker in which
      he had relieved some half a dozen lumbermen of their pay. For the first
      time in his life his winnings brought him no satisfaction. The great law
      of love to his brother troubled him. In vain he argued that it was a fair
      deal and that he himself would have taken his loss without whining. The
      disturbing thoughts would not down. He determined that he would play no
      more till he had talked the matter over with his friend, and he watched
      impatiently for the doctor's return. But that week the doctor failed to
      appear, and &ldquo;Mexico&rdquo; grew increasingly uncertain in his mind and in his
      temper. It added to his wretchedness not a little when the report reached
      him that the doctor was confined to his bed in the hospital at Kuskinook.
      In fact, this news plunged &ldquo;Mexico&rdquo; into deepest gloom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he's took to bed,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there ain't much hope, I guess, for
      they'd never get him there unless he was too far gone to fight 'em off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But at the Kuskinook Hospital there was no anxiety felt in regard to the
      doctor's illness. He was run down with the fall and winter's work. He had
      caught cold, a slight inflammation had set up in the bowels, and that was
      all. The inflammation had been checked and in a few days he would be on
      his feet again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we could only work a scheme to keep him in bed a month,&rdquo; groaned Dick
      to his nurse as they stood beside his bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is, unhappily, no one in authority over him,&rdquo; replied Margaret,
      &ldquo;but we'll keep him ill as long as we can. Dr. Cotton,&rdquo; and here she
      smilingly appealed to the newly appointed assistant, &ldquo;you will help, I am
      sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most certainly. Now we have him down we shall combine to keep him there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, a month at the very least,&rdquo; cried Dick.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Barney laughed their plans to scorn. In two days he promised them he
      would be fit again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the Superintendent of the Hospital against the Medical
      Superintendent of the Crow's Nest Railway,&rdquo; said Dr. Cotton, &ldquo;and I think
      in this case I'll back the former, from what I've seen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; replied Margaret, &ldquo;that is because you haven't known your patient
      long, Doctor. When he speaks the word of command we simply obey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And that is just what happened. On the afternoon of the second day, when
      both the doctor and Dick had gone off to their work and Barney had
      apparently fallen into a quiet sleep, the silence that reigned over the
      flat was broken by Ben Fallows coming up the stair with a telegram in his
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's fer the doctor,&rdquo; said Ben, &ldquo;an' the messenger said as 'ow 'Mexico'
      had got shot and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Swiftly Margaret closed the door of the room in which Barney lay. Ben's
      voice, though not loud, was of a peculiarly penetrating quality. Two words
      had caught Barney's ear, &ldquo;Mexico&rdquo; and &ldquo;shot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me have the wire,&rdquo; he said quietly, when Margaret came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I intended to give it to you, Barney,&rdquo; she replied as quietly. &ldquo;You will
      do nothing rash, I am sure, and you always know best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barney opened the telegram and read, &ldquo;'Mexico' shot. Bullet not found.
      Wants doctor to come if possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dr. Cotton is not in?&rdquo; inquired Barney.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is gone up the Big Horn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can't possibly get him to-night,&rdquo; replied Barney.
    </p>
    <p>
      Silently they looked at each other, thinking rapidly. They each knew that
      the other was ready to do the best, no matter at what cost.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take my temperature, Margaret.&rdquo; It was nine-nine and one-fifth. &ldquo;That's
      not bad,&rdquo; said Barney. &ldquo;Margaret, I must go. It's for 'Mexico's' life.
      Yes, and more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret turned slightly pale. &ldquo;You know best, Barney,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but it
      may be your life, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he replied gravely. &ldquo;I take that chance. But I think I ought to
      take it, don't you?&rdquo; But Margaret refused to speak. &ldquo;What do you think,
      Margaret?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Barney!&rdquo; she cried, with passionate protest, &ldquo;why should you give
      your life for him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; he repeated slowly. &ldquo;There was One who gave His life for me.
      Besides,&rdquo; he added, after a pause, &ldquo;there's a fair chance that I can get
      through.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She threw herself on her knees beside his bed. &ldquo;No, Barney, there's almost
      no chance, you know and I know, and I can't let you go now!&rdquo; The
      passionate love in her voice and in her eyes startled him. Gravely,
      earnestly, his eyes searched her face and read her heart. Slowly the
      crimson rose in her cheeks and flooded the fair face and neck. She buried
      her face in the bed. Gently he laid his hand upon her head, stroking the
      golden hair. For some moments they remained thus, silent. Then, refusing
      to accept the confession of her word and look and act, he said, in a voice
      grave and kind and tender, &ldquo;You expect me to do right, Margaret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A shudder ran through the kneeling girl. Once more the cup of renunciation
      was being pressed to her lips. To the last drop she drained it, then
      raised her head. She was pale but calm. The bright blue eyes looked into
      his bravely while she answered simply, &ldquo;You will do what is right,
      Barney.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just as he was about to start on his journey another wire came in. &ldquo;Didn't
      know you were so ill. Don't you come. I'm all right. 'Mexico.'&rdquo; A rumour
      of the serious nature of the doctor's illness had evidently reached
      &ldquo;Mexico,&rdquo; and he would not have his friend risk his life for him. A fierce
      storm was raging. The out train was hours late, but a light engine ran up
      from the Crossing and brought the doctor down.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he entered the sick man's room &ldquo;Mexico&rdquo; glanced into his face. &ldquo;Good
      Lord, Doctor!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;you shouldn't have come! You're worse than me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, 'Mexico,'&rdquo; replied the doctor cheerfully. &ldquo;I had to come, you
      know. We can't go back on our friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mexico&rdquo; kept his eyes fastened on the doctor's face. His lips began to
      tremble. He put out his hand and clutched the doctor's hard. &ldquo;I know now,&rdquo;
       he said hoarsely, &ldquo;why He let 'em kill Him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Couldn't go back on His friends, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've got it, 'Mexico,' old man. Pretty good, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bet! Now, Doc, get through quick and get to bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The bullet was found in the lung and safely extracted. It was a nasty
      wound and dangerous, but in half an hour &ldquo;Mexico&rdquo; was resting quietly.
      Then the doctor lay down on a couch near by and tossed till morning,
      conscious of a return of the pain and fever. The symptoms he well knew
      indicated a very serious condition. When &ldquo;Mexico&rdquo; woke the doctor examined
      him carefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're fine, 'Mexico.' You'll be all right in a week or two. Keep quiet
      and obey orders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mexico's&rdquo; hand grasped him. &ldquo;Doc,&rdquo; he said anxiously, &ldquo;you look awful
      bad. Can't you get to bed quick? You're going to be terrible sick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid I'm going to be pretty bad, 'Mexico,' but I'm glad I came. I
      couldn't have stayed away, could I? Remember that, 'Mexico.' I'm glad I
      came.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mexico's&rdquo; fierce black eyes softened. &ldquo;Doc, I'm sorry and I'm glad. I had
      a lot of things to ask, but I don't need to. I know now. And I want to
      tell you, I've quit all that business, cut it right out.&rdquo; He waved his
      hand toward the bar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Mexico,'&rdquo; said Barney earnestly, &ldquo;that's great! That's the best news
      I've had all summer. Now I must get back quick.&rdquo; He took the gambler's
      hand in his. &ldquo;Good-bye, 'Mexico.'&rdquo; His voice was earnest, almost solemn.
      &ldquo;You've done me a lot of good. Good-bye, old boy. Play the game. He'll
      never go back on a friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mexico&rdquo; reached out and held him with both hands. &ldquo;Git out,&rdquo; he said to
      the attendant. &ldquo;Doc,&rdquo; his voice dropped to a hoarse whisper as he drew the
      doctor down to him, &ldquo;there ain't nobody here, is there?&rdquo; he asked, with a
      glance round the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, 'Mexico,' no one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doc,&rdquo; he began again, his strong frame shaking, &ldquo;I can't say it. It's all
      in here till it hurts. You're&mdash;you're like Him, I think. You make me
      think o' Him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barney dropped quickly on his knees beside the bed, threw his arms about
      his friend, and held him for a few moments in a tight embrace. &ldquo;God bless
      you, 'Mexico,' for that word,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Goodbye, my friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They held each other fast for a moment or two, looking into each other's
      eyes as if taking a last farewell. Then Barney took his journey through
      the storm, which was still raging, his fever mounting higher with every
      moment, back to the hospital, where Margaret received him with a brave
      welcoming smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dr. Cotton has returned,&rdquo; she announced. &ldquo;And Dr. Neeley of Nelson is
      here, Barney.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gave her a look of understanding. He knew well what she meant. &ldquo;That
      was right, Margaret. And Dick?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dick will be here this afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think of everything, Margaret dear, and everybody except yourself,&rdquo;
       said Barney, as he made his way painfully up the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me help you, Barney,&rdquo; she said, putting her arms about him. &ldquo;You're
      the one who will not think of yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We've all been learning from you, Margaret. And it is the best lesson,
      after all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The consultation left no manner of doubt as to the nature of the trouble
      and the treatment necessary. It was appendicitis, and it demanded
      immediate operation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can wait till my brother comes, can't we, Doctor?&rdquo; Barney asked, a
      little anxiously. &ldquo;An hour can't make much difference now, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, certainly we shall wait,&rdquo; cried the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twenty miles through the storm came Dick, in answer to Margaret's urgent
      message, to find his brother dangerously ill and preparing for a serious
      operation. The meeting of the brothers was without demonstration of
      emotion. Each for the sake of the other held himself firmly in hand. The
      issues were so grave that there was no room for any expenditure of
      strength and indulging in the luxury of grief. Quietly, Barney gave his
      brother the few directions necessary to the disposal of his personal
      effects.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, Dick, I expect to get through all right,&rdquo; he said, with
      cheerful courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; answered Dick, quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it's just as well to say things now when one can think quietly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite right, Barney,&rdquo; said Dick again, his voice steady and even.
    </p>
    <p>
      The remaining minutes they spent in almost complete silence, except for a
      message of remembrance for the mother and the father far away; then the
      doctor came to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you ready, Doctor?&rdquo; said Dick, in a firm, almost cheerful voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, we're all ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A minute, Doctor, please,&rdquo; said Barney.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor backed out of the room, leaving the brothers alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just a little, word, Dick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Barney,&rdquo; cried his brother, his breast heaving in a great sob, &ldquo;I
      don't think I can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind then, old chap,&rdquo; replied Barney, putting out his hand to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a minute, Barney. I will,&rdquo; said Dick, instantly regaining hold of
      himself. As he spoke he knelt by the bed, took his brother's hand in both
      of his and, holding it to his face, spoke quietly and simply his prayer,
      closing with the words, &ldquo;And O, my Father, keep my brother safe.&rdquo; &ldquo;And
      mine,&rdquo; added Barney. &ldquo;Amen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Dick, old boy, we're all ready.&rdquo; And with a smile he met the doctor
      at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an hour all was over, and the grave faces of the doctor and the nurse
      told Dick all he dared not ask.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long before he will be quite conscious again?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be an hour at least,&rdquo; replied the surgeon, kindly, &ldquo;before he can
      talk much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without a word to anyone, Dick went away to his room, locked the door upon
      his lonely fight and came forth when the hour was gone, ready to help his
      brother if he should chance to need help for &ldquo;the last weariness, the
      final strife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must help him,&rdquo; he said to Margaret as they stood together waiting
      till he should waken. &ldquo;We must forget our side just now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he need not have feared for her, nor for Barney. Through the night
      they watched him grow weaker, watched not in growing gloom, but, as it
      were, in an atmosphere bright with the light of hope and warm with strong
      and tender love. At times Barney would wander in his delirium, but a word
      would call him back to them. As the end drew near, by Nature's kindly
      ministry the pain departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is not too bad, Dick,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;How much worse it might have been.
      He brought us two together again&mdash;us three,&rdquo; he corrected, glancing
      at Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Barney,&rdquo; replied Dick, &ldquo;nothing matters much beside that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then,&rdquo; continued his brother, &ldquo;He let me do a little work for the
      boys, for 'Mexico.' Poor 'Mexico'! But he'll stick, I think. Help him,
      Dick. He is my friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mine, too, Barney,&rdquo; said Dick; &ldquo;mine forever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor chaps, they need me. What a chance for some man!&mdash;for a doctor,
      I mean!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll get someone, Barney. Never fear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a chance!&rdquo; he murmured again, wearily, as he fell asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Day dawned clear and still. The storm was gone, the whole world was at
      peace. The mountains and the wide valleys lay beautiful in their unsullied
      robes of purest white, and, over all, the rising sun cast a rosy sheen. As
      Margaret rolled up the blinds and drew back the curtains, letting in the
      glory of the morning, Barney opened his eyes and turned his face toward
      the window, moving his lips in a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bending over him his brother caught the words, &ldquo;Night no more.&rdquo; The great
      day was dawning for him. With a long, lingering look upon the mountains,
      he turned his eyes away from the window and let them rest upon his
      brother's face. &ldquo;It is near now, Dick&mdash;I think&mdash;and it's not
      hard at all. I'd like to sleep out there&mdash;under the pines&mdash;but I
      think mother&mdash;would like&mdash;to have me near.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Barney, my boy. We'll take you home to mother.&rdquo; Dick's voice was
      steady and clear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Margaret,&rdquo; said Barney. She came and knelt where he could see her. An odd
      little smile played over his face. &ldquo;I wasn't worth it, Margaret&mdash;but
      I thank you&mdash;I like to think of it now&mdash;I would like you&mdash;to
      kiss me.&rdquo; She kissed him on the lips once, twice, for a single moment her
      superb courage faltering as she whispered in his ear, &ldquo;Barney, my love! my
      love!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again he smiled up at her. &ldquo;Margaret,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;take care&mdash;of Dick&mdash;for
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Barney, I will.&rdquo; The brave blue eyes and the clear, sweet voice
      carried full conviction to his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know you will,&rdquo; he said with a sigh of content. For a long time he lay
      still, his eyes closed, his breathing growing more rapid. Suddenly he
      opened his eyes, turned himself toward his brother. &ldquo;Dick, my boy,&rdquo; he
      cried, in a clear, strong voice, &ldquo;my brother&mdash;my brother.&rdquo; He lifted
      up both his arms and wound them round Dick's neck, drew a deep breath,
      then another. They waited anxiously. Then one more. Again they waited,
      tense and breathless, but the eternal silence had fallen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's gone, Margaret!&rdquo; cried Dick, in a voice of piteous surprise, lifting
      up a white appealing face to her. &ldquo;He's gone! Oh! he has left us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She came quickly round to him and knelt at his side. &ldquo;We have only each
      other now, Dick,&rdquo; she said, and took him in her arms. And so, in the
      strength of the great love that bound them to the dead, they found courage
      to turn again and live.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three days later, when the road was clear again, they bore him through the
      Pass, the General Manager placing his private car at their disposal. It
      was no poor funeral. It was rather the triumphal procession of a king. At
      every station stood a group of men, silent and sorrow-stricken. It was
      their friend who was being carried past. At Bull Crossing a longer stay
      was made. The station house and platform and the street behind were
      blocked with men who had gathered in from the lumber camps and from down
      the line. One of their number came up, bearing a large wreath of the
      costliest flowers brought from the far south, and laid it on the bier. The
      messenger stood there a moment and then said, hesitatingly, &ldquo;The men would
      like to see him again, if you think best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell them to come,&rdquo; replied Dick, quickly, proceeding to uncover the
      face. For almost an hour they filed past, solemn, silent for the most
      part, but many weeping as only strong men can weep. But as they looked
      upon the strong dead face, its serene dignity, its proud look of triumph
      subdued their sobbing, and they passed out awed and somewhat comforted.
      The look on that dead face forbade pity. They might grieve for the loss of
      their friend, but to him the best had come.
    </p>
    <p>
      By Margaret's side stood Tommy Tate, till the last. &ldquo;Ochone!&rdquo; he sobbed,
      &ldquo;when I think of mesilf me heart is bruck entirely, but when I luk at him
      I feel no pain at all.&rdquo; It was the feeling in the hearts of all. For
      themselves they must weep, but not for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, all had gone. &ldquo;Could you say a word to them, Dick?&rdquo; said
      Margaret. &ldquo;I think he would like it.&rdquo; And Dick, drawing a deep breath,
      went forth to them. His words were few and simple. &ldquo;We must not speak
      words of grief to-day. He was glad to help you and he grew to love you as
      his friends. In his last hours he thought of you. I know you will not
      forget him. But were he giving me my words to-day, he would not ask me to
      speak of him, but of the One who made him what he was, Whom he loved and
      served with his life. For His sake it was, and for yours, that he gave
      himself to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As his voice ceased a commotion rose at the back of the crowd. A sleigh
      dashed up, two men got out, helping a third, before whom the crowd quickly
      made way. It was &ldquo;Mexico,&rdquo; pale, feeble, leaning heavily upon his friends.
      He came up to Dick. &ldquo;May I see him?&rdquo; he asked humbly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; said Dick, giving him both his hands and lifting him on to the
      platform, while a great sob swept over the crowd. They all knew by this
      time that it was to save &ldquo;Mexico&rdquo; the doctor had given his life. With
      heads bared they waited till &ldquo;Mexico&rdquo; came out again. As he appeared on
      the platform of the car with Dick's arm supporting him, the men gazed at
      him in deathly stillness. The ghastly face with its fierce, gleaming eyes
      held them as with a spell. For a moment &ldquo;Mexico&rdquo; stood leaning heavily
      upon Dick, but suddenly he drew himself erect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boys,&rdquo; he said, his voice hoarse and broken, but distinctly audible over
      the crowd, &ldquo;he died because he wouldn't go back on his friend. He gave me
      this.&rdquo; He took from his breast the New Testament, held it up and carried
      it reverently to his lips. &ldquo;I'm a-goin' to follow that trail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Two thousand miles and more they carried him home to his mother, and then
      to the old churchyard, where he sleeps still, forgotten, perhaps, even by
      many who had known and played with him in his boyhood, but remembered by
      the men of the mountains who had once felt the touch of that strong love
      that gave the best and freely for their sakes, and for His Whom it was his
      pride and joy to call Master and Friend.

    <h3>
      FOR LOVE'S SAKE
    </h3>
    <p>
      Again it was June, and over all the fields Nature's ancient miracle had
      been wrought. The trees by the snake fences stood in the full pride of
      their rich leafage, casting deep shadows on the growing grains. As of old,
      the Mill lane, with its velvet grassy banks, ran between snake fences,
      sweet-scented, cool, and shaded. Between the rails peeped the clover, red
      and white. Over the top rail nodded the rich berries of the dogwood, while
      the sturdy thorns held bravely aloft their hard green clusters waiting the
      sun's warm passion. The singing voices of summer were all a-throb, filling
      the air with great antiphonies of praise, till this good June day was
      fairly wild with the sheer joy of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the crest of the hill Margaret paused. This was Barney's spot. &ldquo;I'll
      wait here,&rdquo; she said to herself, a faint flush lighting up the chaste
      beauty of her face. But the hot sun beat down upon her with his fierce
      rays. &ldquo;I must get into the shade,&rdquo; she said, climbed the fence, and, on
      the fragrant masses of red clover, threw herself down in the shade of the
      thorn tree. On this spot, how vividly the past came to her. How well she
      remembered the heartache of that day so long ago. The ache would never
      quite be gone, but with it mingled now a sweetness that only love knows
      how to distil from pity where trust is and high esteem.
    </p>
    <p>
      A year had passed since she had sent Dick back alone to his work,
      remaining herself to bring the lonely hearts of the Old Mill such help and
      comfort as she could. At the parting with him, Barney's words, &ldquo;Take care
      of Dick for me,&rdquo; had moved her to offer with shy courage to go back with
      him. But Dick was far too generous to avail himself of any such
      persuasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must not come to me for pity,&rdquo; he said, bidding her good-bye.
    </p>
    <p>
      But throughout the year she had waited, listening to her heart and
      wondering at its throbs, as from time to time the story of Dick's heroic
      service came to her ears; and now the year was done. Last night he had
      returned. To-day he would come to her. She would meet him here. Ah, there
      he was now. On the crest of the hill he would turn and look toward her.
      There, he had turned.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Dick caught sight of her he raised his voice in a shout, &ldquo;Margaret!&rdquo;
       and came running toward her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose, and with her hands pressed hard upon her heart to quiet the
      throbbing that threatened to choke her, she stood waiting him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Touching a top rail, he vaulted lightly over the fence and stood there
      waiting. &ldquo;Margaret!&rdquo; he cried again, with a note of anxiety in his voice
      that trembled under the intensity of his feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      But still she could not move for the tumult of joy that possessed her.
      &ldquo;Oh, I am so glad,&rdquo; she whispered to herself. Dick came toward her slowly,
      almost timidly, it seemed to her. He took her hands down from her breast,
      held her at arm's length, seeking to read the meaning in the blue eyes
      lifted so bravely to his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For pity's sake, Margaret?&rdquo; he asked, the note of anxiety deepening in
      his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment she stood pouring her heart's love into his eyes. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she
      said, shyly dropping her eyes before his ardent gaze, &ldquo;and for love's
      sake, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And for Dick the day's gladness grew riotous, filling his world full from
      earth to heaven above.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
